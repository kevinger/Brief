  <h1>A Brief on corporate taxes</h1>
  
    <h2>International income, offshore profits, tax avoidance</h2>
    <h3><a href=http://www.aei.org/publication/why-70-of-companies-paid-zero-in-corporate-taxes-they-had-zero-profits/>Why 70 percent of companies paid zero in corporate taxes: They had zero profits</a></h3>
    <b>www.aei.org</b>
    <p>In 2012, out of 1.6 million corporate tax returns, only 51% were returns that had positive net incomes, and only 32% were returns that had positive incomes subject to tax. These losses can be carried forward to offset taxable incomes in years when firms are making a profit or have positive net incomes; this is known as a net operating loss deduction (NOLD). So my analysis of the data shows two things: first, the GAO claim that 70% of companies paid no income tax is largely because more than 50% of these companies had zero profits or net incomes, and therefore they had zero tax liability. So, the GAO clearly acknowledges that the reason 70% of companies are paying no taxes is because they are either not currently profitable or they are able to offset taxes because of prior-year losses. Using taxable income to compute ETRs, I find that effective tax rates are fairly close to the statutory rate of 35%, at least when using aggregate data. </p>

    <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
    <p>Abstract This paper examines how changes to the individual income tax affect long-term economic growth. Base-broadening measures can eliminate the effect of tax rate cuts on budget deficits, but at the same time, they reduce the impact on labor supply, saving, and investment and thus reduce the direct impact on growth. They may also reallocate resources across sectors toward their highest-value economic use, resulting in increased efficiency and potentially raising the overall size of the economy. In 2014, for example, Representative Dave Camp (R-MI) proposed a sweeping reform to the income tax system that would reduce rates, greatly pare back subsidies in the tax code, and maintain revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens across income classes (Committee on Ways and Means 2014). Section VII concludes.1[1] There are a number of related issues that are both interesting and important, but beyond the scope of the paper  including, for example, the elasticity of taxable income, the relationship between inequality (especially as it is affected by the tax system) and growth, the effects of corporate income tax reform on growth and the detailed literatures on the effects of taxes on labor supply, saving, and investment. </p>

    <p>The TCJA would raise over $200 billion by taxing the cash and equivalent portion at about 14 percent and the reinvested portion at 7 percent. For post-2017 foreign earnings, the TCJA adopts what is called a participation exemption approach: Dividends from foreign subsidiary corporations will be generally exempt from US taxationbut with important exceptions. Congress feared that a pure territorial system would encourage US firms to locate facilities in low tax countries to serve the American market, purchase inputs from related firms in low tax countries, or continue to transfer patents, copyrights, and trademarks to such countries. The ministers go on to cite WTO rules that prohibit export subsidiesthis with reference to the preferential 13.1 percent rate on intangible income from abroad. Note 1 The characterization of the new tax as an excise tax is odd, since it is quite different from familiar excise taxes on alcohol or tobacco. </p>

    <p>In this environment, business taxes  more specifically, corporate income taxes  are natural targets for legislative tax-raisers. Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980) drew attention to the possibility that using Harbergers (1962) celebrated tax incidence model, corporate income tax burdens might be borne more than 100% by workers, whose wages could fall so much in response to the reallocation of resources triggered by the corporate tax (reduced corporate output and greater non-corporate output) that owners of corporations actually could come out ahead. Comparing workers in states with tax rates above 9% to those in states with tax rates below 4%, the evidence is that union wage premiums are $1.88/hour higher in the low-tax states than in the high-tax states. Our first method compares workers in highly capital-intensive industries with those in less capital-intensive industries.

    <p>Share The House and Senate have passed bills cutting the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent. This overdue reform will spur capital investment, strengthen the economy, and reduce tax avoidance. Republicans have long championed this reform, and President Trump had proposed an even lower rate.

         <b>econofact.org</b>
         <p>The Issue:Although many details of tax reform are still to be fleshed out, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent is a central component of the proposals by Congressional Republicans and the Trump Administration. There is legitimate debate among economists regarding who bears the brunt of the corporate tax. Some critics contend that this tax regime reduces the amount of business investment and expansion, and limits the amount of foreign earnings that are used for domestic investment in the United States (see this EconoFact memo for details). The C. E.A. report hypothesizes that lowering corporate taxes would raise U. S. wages through a chain of three effects: first, the lower effective tax rate boosts investment; then, the increased investment raises the productivity of labor; and, finally, workers get higher wages as they become more productive. Ideally, corporate tax reform should not have an adverse effect on government revenue, should reduce distortions that make people respond to tax incentives rather than underlying economic considerations, and should eliminate current incentives that discourage companies from distributing their profits to their shareholders. </p>

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>Because the United States has so many generous special tax preferences for businesses, it collects the fourth lowest corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP among all OECD countries. Over the last decade, Congress has responded to these problems by cutting tax rates on capital income. Capital gains and dividend taxes have been reduced in the last ten years and the Wall Street Journal editorial page has started gunning for the corporate tax rate as a next step. Without adding to the deficit burden, this rate reduction would be fully paid for by a series of measures to broaden the corporate tax base to ensure that different forms of investments are taxed at similar rates. The Rangel plan proposes one way to end this subsidy, though others could be considered as well. </p>

Corporate tax has fallen from a 1952 high of 32 percent of all federal tax revenue, representing over 6 percent of GDP, to accounting for less than 11 percent of revenue in 2016, or less than 2 percent of GDP. More businesses are choosing to file as sole proprietorships, partnerships, or limited liability companies, which are known as pass-through businesses because their profits are taxed only as they relate to the individual incomes of the owners. The systems high rate is a particular target: according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the federal corporate rate of 35 percent (over 39 percent when state and local taxes are considered) is the third highest in the world, and the highest among the developed economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). </p>

         <b>www.cato.org</b>
         <p>Some policymakers argue in favor of higher taxes on corporations to reduce inequality, while others endorse policies that make firms in their countries more innovative. Does changing corporate tax policy also affect future firm innovation? While introducing the administrations new framework for corporate taxation on February 22, 2012, President Barack Obama alluded to this issue by saying that my administration released a framework  that lowers the corporate tax rate and broadens the tax base in order to increase competitiveness for companies across the nation. Unlike federal tax changes that occur infrequently and affect all firms simultaneously, states changes occur at different times, helping isolate the effects of tax changes from other changes that might also affect firm innovation. In terms of economic magnitude, a 1.5 percentage point increase in the state corporate income tax rate from a mean value of around 7 percent leads to approximately 37 percent of affected firms to file one fewer patent within the next two years, compared to a mean of about 9.1 patents per firm-year. </p>

         <p>At 35 percent, it is, nominally, higher than rates in other advanced economies  a factor that companies consider when they select where to invest. Reducing the corporate rate to 20 percent while dropping some deductions is one of Republican leaders top policy priorities: It is the bedrock underpinning a 429-page tax plan House Republicans announced on November 2, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It will also look at controversial pass-through taxation that critics of the Republican plan fear will be abused by the rich. Under the current tax code, the firm deducts the interest from its taxable income and pays tax only on $60 million  its profits after interest payments. If Washington wants to stop companies from taking advantage of tax-friendly environments overseas, or relocating altogether, it can start by making the United States a place where companies want to conduct business, wrote Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, after Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016. </p>

         <b>www.cato.org</b>
         <p>Despite opponents attempts to suggest otherwise, there is reason to be confident that cutting the corporate tax rate will raise the wages of millions of workers. Progressive groups like Americans for Tax Fairness paint corporate tax cuts as a giveaway to wealthy corporations and their shareholders, which will reduce government revenues and, in time, lead to fewer government services for the poor. Yesterday, a WSJ/NBC poll found that 55 percent of Americans wanted to increase taxes on corporations and another 25 percent wanted to keep such taxes as they are. Its cost is ultimately borne by some combination of shareholders (through lower dividends or less valuable shares), workers (through lower wages), and consumers (through higher prices). Britain and Canada, in particular, have shown that it is possible to substantially cut rates without meaningfully reducing corporate revenues as a proportion of GDP. </p>

         <p>Their owners must include an allocated share of the businesses profits in their taxable income under the individual income tax. Two states, Ohio and Texas, tax corporations gross receipts instead of income. State governments collected $49 billion in revenue (3 percent of state general revenue) from corporate income taxes in 2015. Local governments collected only $9 billion in revenue (1 percent of local government general revenue) because just seven states allow local governments to levy the tax. Since the Great Recession, several states have changed their treatment of NOLs; most of those changes have been to extend the number of carry-forward years to conform to the federal rules. </p>

         <b>equitablegrowth.org</b>
         <p>While most policymakers agree that tax reform is overdue, true reform seems far less likely than poorly designed corporate tax cuts, and economic research shows that the results from such tax cuts are likely to be deeply disappointing to American workers. The benefits from these corporate tax cuts would accrue to corporate shareholders and senior managersthe same groups that have prospered the most in recent decades, while wages for middle-class Americans have stagnated. If policymakers actually want to help American middle-class workers with tax cuts, they should simply direct those tax cuts to the taxes these workers pay. There is no question that workers pay nearly all payroll and labor income taxes, including the portion of the payroll tax ostensibly paid by employers since workers pay for the employer portion of the payroll tax in the form of lower wages. For corporate tax cuts to benefit workers, the resulting increase in corporate after-tax profits would need to fuel new investments, those new investments would need to increase the productivity of labor, and the higher productivity would need to boost wages. </p>

         <b>voxeu.org</b>
         <p>Eliminating the US corporate tax by, for example, taxing accrued global corporate profits as personal income can produce dramatic increases in US investment, output, real wages, and saving. For their part, many Republicans would applaud switching from wage to retail sales taxation, but would be appalled by wealth taxation. The difference between the 35% marginal effective US corporate tax rate, recently estimated by Mintz and Chen (2013), and the 13% average tax rate, suggested by the US National Income Accounts, tells us an important fact. Importantly, we also find substantial, if smaller, gains to US workers  particularly young and future workers  if other countries match the US and also eliminate their corporate income taxes. Concluding remarks Eliminating the corporate income tax could be implemented (http://www.thecommonsensetax.org/) as part of corporate tax integration in which shareholders are required to pay tax at the personal level on their shares of their companies profits as those profits accrue. </p>

         <p>If they really care about helping workers and reducing poverty, they should rethink their opposition. Supporters of corporate-tax reform point out that the United States has one of the highest effective marginal corporate-tax rates in the world at 38.9 percent when both state and federal taxes are considered. Critics counter that the effective average corporate rate is actually much lower, with estimates ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent. The marginal tax rate reflects the amount of taxes that a company will pay on the next dollar of income earned, while the average effective tax rate is calculated based on the amount of taxes that companies actually pay after taking into account all exclusions and deductions. The administrations continuing refusal to embrace spending cuts means that it runs the risk of ballooning our $20 trillion national debt in pursuit of (sorely needed) tax cuts. </p>

         <p>In 2012, out of 1.6 million corporate tax returns, only 51% were returns that had positive net incomes, and only 32% were returns that had positive incomes subject to tax. These losses can be carried forward to offset taxable incomes in years when firms are making a profit or have positive net incomes; this is known as a net operating loss deduction (NOLD). So my analysis of the data shows two things: first, the GAO claim that 70% of companies paid no income tax is largely because more than 50% of these companies had zero profits or net incomes, and therefore they had zero tax liability. So, the GAO clearly acknowledges that the reason 70% of companies are paying no taxes is because they are either not currently profitable or they are able to offset taxes because of prior-year losses. Using taxable income to compute ETRs, I find that effective tax rates are fairly close to the statutory rate of 35%, at least when using aggregate data. </p>

Its true that reducing the tax rate to 28% would lower tax revenues by $840 billion over the next 10 years (the standard period for revenue estimates), but the budget suggests that this revenue loss can be offset by closing loopholes in the corporate tax code.

         <b>econofact.org</b>
         <p>The Issue:Although many details of tax reform are still to be fleshed out, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent is a central component of the proposals by Congressional Republicans and the Trump Administration. There is legitimate debate among economists regarding who bears the brunt of the corporate tax. Some critics contend that this tax regime reduces the amount of business investment and expansion, and limits the amount of foreign earnings that are used for domestic investment in the United States (see this EconoFact memo for details). The C. E.A. report hypothesizes that lowering corporate taxes would raise U. S. wages through a chain of three effects: first, the lower effective tax rate boosts investment; then, the increased investment raises the productivity of labor; and, finally, workers get higher wages as they become more productive. Ideally, corporate tax reform should not have an adverse effect on government revenue, should reduce distortions that make people respond to tax incentives rather than underlying economic considerations, and should eliminate current incentives that discourage companies from distributing their profits to their shareholders. </p>

         <p>The current method of taxing the profits of large, publicly traded corporations was designed for an economy in which international investment was relatively unimportant and most corporate profits were produced by tangible assets, such as machinery and buildings. As a result the United States should consider more significant reforms, such as leading an international effort to develop new rules to allocate corporate profits among countries or scrapping the corporate income tax entirely and replacing it with a direct tax on shareholders. By taxing corporate income at both the corporate and shareholder level, it encourages businesses to organize themselves as limited partnerships or subchapter S corporations so that they face only a single level of tax and favors sectors, such as agriculture and real estate, in which non-corporate structures have been prevalent. Depreciation rules and other special provisions favor investment in some industries over others for both taxable corporations and other businesses, causing capital to flow to less productive uses than they would with neutral tax rules. These rules encourage U. S., but not foreign-owned corporations, to retain profits overseas and may place U.

         <p>Because the United States has so many generous special tax preferences for businesses, it collects the fourth lowest corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP among all OECD countries. Over the last decade, Congress has responded to these problems by cutting tax rates on capital income. Capital gains and dividend taxes have been reduced in the last ten years and the Wall Street Journal editorial page has started gunning for the corporate tax rate as a next step. Without adding to the deficit burden, this rate reduction would be fully paid for by a series of measures to broaden the corporate tax base to ensure that different forms of investments are taxed at similar rates. The Rangel plan proposes one way to end this subsidy, though others could be considered as well. </p>

         <p>Eliminating the US corporate tax by, for example, taxing accrued global corporate profits as personal income can produce dramatic increases in US investment, output, real wages, and saving. For their part, many Republicans would applaud switching from wage to retail sales taxation, but would be appalled by wealth taxation. The difference between the 35% marginal effective US corporate tax rate, recently estimated by Mintz and Chen (2013), and the 13% average tax rate, suggested by the US National Income Accounts, tells us an important fact. Importantly, we also find substantial, if smaller, gains to US workers  particularly young and future workers  if other countries match the US and also eliminate their corporate income taxes. Concluding remarks Eliminating the corporate income tax could be implemented (http://www.thecommonsensetax.org/) as part of corporate tax integration in which shareholders are required to pay tax at the personal level on their shares of their companies profits as those profits accrue. </p>

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>Abstract This paper examines how changes to the individual income tax affect long-term economic growth. Base-broadening measures can eliminate the effect of tax rate cuts on budget deficits, but at the same time, they reduce the impact on labor supply, saving, and investment and thus reduce the direct impact on growth. They may also reallocate resources across sectors toward their highest-value economic use, resulting in increased efficiency and potentially raising the overall size of the economy. In 2014, for example, Representative Dave Camp (R-MI) proposed a sweeping reform to the income tax system that would reduce rates, greatly pare back subsidies in the tax code, and maintain revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens across income classes (Committee on Ways and Means 2014). Section VII concludes.1[1] There are a number of related issues that are both interesting and important, but beyond the scope of the paper  including, for example, the elasticity of taxable income, the relationship between inequality (especially as it is affected by the tax system) and growth, the effects of corporate income tax reform on growth and the detailed literatures on the effects of taxes on labor supply, saving, and investment. </p>

         <p>While most policymakers agree that tax reform is overdue, true reform seems far less likely than poorly designed corporate tax cuts, and economic research shows that the results from such tax cuts are likely to be deeply disappointing to American workers. The benefits from these corporate tax cuts would accrue to corporate shareholders and senior managersthe same groups that have prospered the most in recent decades, while wages for middle-class Americans have stagnated. If policymakers actually want to help American middle-class workers with tax cuts, they should simply direct those tax cuts to the taxes these workers pay. There is no question that workers pay nearly all payroll and labor income taxes, including the portion of the payroll tax ostensibly paid by employers since workers pay for the employer portion of the payroll tax in the form of lower wages. For corporate tax cuts to benefit workers, the resulting increase in corporate after-tax profits would need to fuel new investments, those new investments would need to increase the productivity of labor, and the higher productivity would need to boost wages. </p>

Supporters of corporate-tax reform point out that the United States has one of the highest effective marginal corporate-tax rates in the world at 38.9 percent when both state and federal taxes are considered. Critics counter that the effective average corporate rate is actually much lower, with estimates ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent. The marginal tax rate reflects the amount of taxes that a company will pay on the next dollar of income earned, while the average effective tax rate is calculated based on the amount of taxes that companies actually pay after taking into account all exclusions and deductions.

In November 2017, House Republicans released their proposed tax reform legislation, which will be followed by intense negotiations over the details to win enough support for passage in both the House and Senate. Corporate tax has fallen from a 1952 high of 32 percent of all federal tax revenue, representing over 6 percent of GDP, to accounting for less than 11 percent of revenue in 2016, or less than 2 percent of GDP. More businesses are choosing to file as sole proprietorships, partnerships, or limited liability companies, which are known as pass-through businesses because their profits are taxed only as they relate to the individual incomes of the owners. The systems high rate is a particular target: according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the federal corporate rate of 35 percent (over 39 percent when state and local taxes are considered) is the third highest in the world, and the highest among the developed economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). </p>

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>Abstract This paper examines how changes to the individual income tax affect long-term economic growth. Base-broadening measures can eliminate the effect of tax rate cuts on budget deficits, but at the same time, they reduce the impact on labor supply, saving, and investment and thus reduce the direct impact on growth. They may also reallocate resources across sectors toward their highest-value economic use, resulting in increased efficiency and potentially raising the overall size of the economy. In 2014, for example, Representative Dave Camp (R-MI) proposed a sweeping reform to the income tax system that would reduce rates, greatly pare back subsidies in the tax code, and maintain revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens across income classes (Committee on Ways and Means 2014). Section VII concludes.1[1] There are a number of related issues that are both interesting and important, but beyond the scope of the paper  including, for example, the elasticity of taxable income, the relationship between inequality (especially as it is affected by the tax system) and growth, the effects of corporate income tax reform on growth and the detailed literatures on the effects of taxes on labor supply, saving, and investment. </p>

         <b>voxeu.org</b>
         <p>Eliminating the US corporate tax by, for example, taxing accrued global corporate profits as personal income can produce dramatic increases in US investment, output, real wages, and saving. For their part, many Republicans would applaud switching from wage to retail sales taxation, but would be appalled by wealth taxation. The difference between the 35% marginal effective US corporate tax rate, recently estimated by Mintz and Chen (2013), and the 13% average tax rate, suggested by the US National Income Accounts, tells us an important fact. Importantly, we also find substantial, if smaller, gains to US workers  particularly young and future workers  if other countries match the US and also eliminate their corporate income taxes. Concluding remarks Eliminating the corporate income tax could be implemented (http://www.thecommonsensetax.org/) as part of corporate tax integration in which shareholders are required to pay tax at the personal level on their shares of their companies profits as those profits accrue. </p>

         <p>If they really care about helping workers and reducing poverty, they should rethink their opposition. Supporters of corporate-tax reform point out that the United States has one of the highest effective marginal corporate-tax rates in the world at 38.9 percent when both state and federal taxes are considered. Critics counter that the effective average corporate rate is actually much lower, with estimates ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent. The marginal tax rate reflects the amount of taxes that a company will pay on the next dollar of income earned, while the average effective tax rate is calculated based on the amount of taxes that companies actually pay after taking into account all exclusions and deductions. The administrations continuing refusal to embrace spending cuts means that it runs the risk of ballooning our $20 trillion national debt in pursuit of (sorely needed) tax cuts. </p>

         <b>www.aei.org</b>
         <p>In 2012, out of 1.6 million corporate tax returns, only 51% were returns that had positive net incomes, and only 32% were returns that had positive incomes subject to tax. These losses can be carried forward to offset taxable incomes in years when firms are making a profit or have positive net incomes; this is known as a net operating loss deduction (NOLD). So my analysis of the data shows two things: first, the GAO claim that 70% of companies paid no income tax is largely because more than 50% of these companies had zero profits or net incomes, and therefore they had zero tax liability. So, the GAO clearly acknowledges that the reason 70% of companies are paying no taxes is because they are either not currently profitable or they are able to offset taxes because of prior-year losses. Using taxable income to compute ETRs, I find that effective tax rates are fairly close to the statutory rate of 35%, at least when using aggregate data. </p>

         <p>U. S. multinationals have chosen to defer indefinitely the payment of US taxes on $2 trillion in foreign profits by keeping them abroad. General Electric holds $110 billion in foreign profits abroad; Microsoft $76 billion and Pfizer $69 billion, according to Audit Analytics. A substantial portion of foreign profits of U. S. multinationals would likely be brought back to the United States to build plants, buy technologies and pay dividends. Its true that reducing the tax rate to 28% would lower tax revenues by $840 billion over the next 10 years (the standard period for revenue estimates), but the budget suggests that this revenue loss can be offset by closing loopholes in the corporate tax code. In short, although the tax rates in the budget may be too high, Republicans should be attracted by some of its ideas  allowing foreign profits to be repatriated to the United States at a relatively low rate and bringing the U.

         <p>The Issue:Although many details of tax reform are still to be fleshed out, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent is a central component of the proposals by Congressional Republicans and the Trump Administration. There is legitimate debate among economists regarding who bears the brunt of the corporate tax. Some critics contend that this tax regime reduces the amount of business investment and expansion, and limits the amount of foreign earnings that are used for domestic investment in the United States (see this EconoFact memo for details). The C. E.A. report hypothesizes that lowering corporate taxes would raise U. S. wages through a chain of three effects: first, the lower effective tax rate boosts investment; then, the increased investment raises the productivity of labor; and, finally, workers get higher wages as they become more productive. Ideally, corporate tax reform should not have an adverse effect on government revenue, should reduce distortions that make people respond to tax incentives rather than underlying economic considerations, and should eliminate current incentives that discourage companies from distributing their profits to their shareholders. </p>

         <p>The current method of taxing the profits of large, publicly traded corporations was designed for an economy in which international investment was relatively unimportant and most corporate profits were produced by tangible assets, such as machinery and buildings. As a result the United States should consider more significant reforms, such as leading an international effort to develop new rules to allocate corporate profits among countries or scrapping the corporate income tax entirely and replacing it with a direct tax on shareholders. By taxing corporate income at both the corporate and shareholder level, it encourages businesses to organize themselves as limited partnerships or subchapter S corporations so that they face only a single level of tax and favors sectors, such as agriculture and real estate, in which non-corporate structures have been prevalent. Depreciation rules and other special provisions favor investment in some industries over others for both taxable corporations and other businesses, causing capital to flow to less productive uses than they would with neutral tax rules. These rules encourage U. S., but not foreign-owned corporations, to retain profits overseas and may place U. S. companies at a disadvantage compared with their foreign competitors who do not pay home-country tax on their foreign profits. </p>

         <p>Because the United States has so many generous special tax preferences for businesses, it collects the fourth lowest corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP among all OECD countries. Over the last decade, Congress has responded to these problems by cutting tax rates on capital income. Capital gains and dividend taxes have been reduced in the last ten years and the Wall Street Journal editorial page has started gunning for the corporate tax rate as a next step. Without adding to the deficit burden, this rate reduction would be fully paid for by a series of measures to broaden the corporate tax base to ensure that different forms of investments are taxed at similar rates.

In November 2017, House Republicans released their proposed tax reform legislation, which will be followed by intense negotiations over the details to win enough support for passage in both the House and Senate. Corporate tax has fallen from a 1952 high of 32 percent of all federal tax revenue, representing over 6 percent of GDP, to accounting for less than 11 percent of revenue in 2016, or less than 2 percent of GDP. More businesses are choosing to file as sole proprietorships, partnerships, or limited liability companies, which are known as pass-through businesses because their profits are taxed only as they relate to the individual incomes of the owners. The systems high rate is a particular target: according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the federal corporate rate of 35 percent (over 39 percent when state and local taxes are considered) is the third highest in the world, and the highest among the developed economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). </p>

         <p>In this environment, business taxes  more specifically, corporate income taxes  are natural targets for legislative tax-raisers. Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980) drew attention to the possibility that using Harbergers (1962) celebrated tax incidence model, corporate income tax burdens might be borne more than 100% by workers, whose wages could fall so much in response to the reallocation of resources triggered by the corporate tax (reduced corporate output and greater non-corporate output) that owners of corporations actually could come out ahead. Comparing workers in states with tax rates above 9% to those in states with tax rates below 4%, the evidence is that union wage premiums are $1.88/hour higher in the low-tax states than in the high-tax states. Our first method compares workers in highly capital-intensive industries with those in less capital-intensive industries.

The systems high rate is a particular target: according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the federal corporate rate of 35 percent (over 39 percent when state and local taxes are considered) is the third highest in the world, and the highest among the developed economies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). </p>

         <p>While most policymakers agree that tax reform is overdue, true reform seems far less likely than poorly designed corporate tax cuts, and economic research shows that the results from such tax cuts are likely to be deeply disappointing to American workers. The benefits from these corporate tax cuts would accrue to corporate shareholders and senior managersthe same groups that have prospered the most in recent decades, while wages for middle-class Americans have stagnated. If policymakers actually want to help American middle-class workers with tax cuts, they should simply direct those tax cuts to the taxes these workers pay. There is no question that workers pay nearly all payroll and labor income taxes, including the portion of the payroll tax ostensibly paid by employers since workers pay for the employer portion of the payroll tax in the form of lower wages. For corporate tax cuts to benefit workers, the resulting increase in corporate after-tax profits would need to fuel new investments, those new investments would need to increase the productivity of labor, and the higher productivity would need to boost wages. </p>

         <p>In 2012, out of 1.6 million corporate tax returns, only 51% were returns that had positive net incomes, and only 32% were returns that had positive incomes subject to tax. These losses can be carried forward to offset taxable incomes in years when firms are making a profit or have positive net incomes; this is known as a net operating loss deduction (NOLD). So my analysis of the data shows two things: first, the GAO claim that 70% of companies paid no income tax is largely because more than 50% of these companies had zero profits or net incomes, and therefore they had zero tax liability. So, the GAO clearly acknowledges that the reason 70% of companies are paying no taxes is because they are either not currently profitable or they are able to offset taxes because of prior-year losses. Using taxable income to compute ETRs, I find that effective tax rates are fairly close to the statutory rate of 35%, at least when using aggregate data. </p>

         <b>econofact.org</b>
         <p>The Issue:Although many details of tax reform are still to be fleshed out, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent is a central component of the proposals by Congressional Republicans and the Trump Administration. There is legitimate debate among economists regarding who bears the brunt of the corporate tax. Some critics contend that this tax regime reduces the amount of business investment and expansion, and limits the amount of foreign earnings that are used for domestic investment in the United States (see this EconoFact memo for details). The C. E.A. report hypothesizes that lowering corporate taxes would raise U. S. wages through a chain of three effects: first, the lower effective tax rate boosts investment; then, the increased investment raises the productivity of labor; and, finally, workers get higher wages as they become more productive. Ideally, corporate tax reform should not have an adverse effect on government revenue, should reduce distortions that make people respond to tax incentives rather than underlying economic considerations, and should eliminate current incentives that discourage companies from distributing their profits to their shareholders. </p>

         <p>The TCJA would raise over $200 billion by taxing the cash and equivalent portion at about 14 percent and the reinvested portion at 7 percent. For post-2017 foreign earnings, the TCJA adopts what is called a participation exemption approach: Dividends from foreign subsidiary corporations will be generally exempt from US taxationbut with important exceptions. Congress feared that a pure territorial system would encourage US firms to locate facilities in low tax countries to serve the American market, purchase inputs from related firms in low tax countries, or continue to transfer patents, copyrights, and trademarks to such countries. The ministers go on to cite WTO rules that prohibit export subsidiesthis with reference to the preferential 13.1 percent rate on intangible income from abroad. Note 1 The characterization of the new tax as an excise tax is odd, since it is quite different from familiar excise taxes on alcohol or tobacco. </p>

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>Abstract This paper examines how changes to the individual income tax affect long-term economic growth. Base-broadening measures can eliminate the effect of tax rate cuts on budget deficits, but at the same time, they reduce the impact on labor supply, saving, and investment and thus reduce the direct impact on growth. They may also reallocate resources across sectors toward their highest-value economic use, resulting in increased efficiency and potentially raising the overall size of the economy. In 2014, for example, Representative Dave Camp (R-MI) proposed a sweeping reform to the income tax system that would reduce rates, greatly pare back subsidies in the tax code, and maintain revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens across income classes (Committee on Ways and Means 2014). Section VII concludes.1[1] There are a number of related issues that are both interesting and important, but beyond the scope of the paper  including, for example, the elasticity of taxable income, the relationship between inequality (especially as it is affected by the tax system) and growth, the effects of corporate income tax reform on growth and the detailed literatures on the effects of taxes on labor supply, saving, and investment. </p>

         <p>U. S. multinationals have chosen to defer indefinitely the payment of US taxes on $2 trillion in foreign profits by keeping them abroad. General Electric holds $110 billion in foreign profits abroad; Microsoft $76 billion and Pfizer $69 billion, according to Audit Analytics. A substantial portion of foreign profits of U. S. multinationals would likely be brought back to the United States to build plants, buy technologies and pay dividends. Its true that reducing the tax rate to 28% would lower tax revenues by $840 billion over the next 10 years (the standard period for revenue estimates), but the budget suggests that this revenue loss can be offset by closing loopholes in the corporate tax code. In short, although the tax rates in the budget may be too high, Republicans should be attracted by some of its ideas  allowing foreign profits to be repatriated to the United States at a relatively low rate and bringing the U. S. corporate tax rate closer to the global norm. </p>

         <p>Because the United States has so many generous special tax preferences for businesses, it collects the fourth lowest corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP among all OECD countries. Over the last decade, Congress has responded to these problems by cutting tax rates on capital income. Capital gains and dividend taxes have been reduced in the last ten years and the Wall Street Journal editorial page has started gunning for the corporate tax rate as a next step. Without adding to the deficit burden, this rate reduction would be fully paid for by a series of measures to broaden the corporate tax base to ensure that different forms of investments are taxed at similar rates. The Rangel plan proposes one way to end this subsidy, though others could be considered as well. </p>

Local governments collected only $9 billion in revenue (1 percent of local government general revenue) because just seven states allow local governments to levy the tax.

         <p>Share The House and Senate have passed bills cutting the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent. This overdue reform will spur capital investment, strengthen the economy, and reduce tax avoidance. Republicans have long championed this reform, and President Trump had proposed an even lower rate. So it was surprising that the president commented Saturday that a 22 percent rate would be fine. American businesses generally face their biggest competition from businesses in Asia and Europe, and those are the regions with the lowest rates. </p>

         <p>Some policymakers argue in favor of higher taxes on corporations to reduce inequality, while others endorse policies that make firms in their countries more innovative. Does changing corporate tax policy also affect future firm innovation? While introducing the administrations new framework for corporate taxation on February 22, 2012, President Barack Obama alluded to this issue by saying that my administration released a framework  that lowers the corporate tax rate and broadens the tax base in order to increase competitiveness for companies across the nation. Unlike federal tax changes that occur infrequently and affect all firms simultaneously, states changes occur at different times, helping isolate the effects of tax changes from other changes that might also affect firm innovation. In terms of economic magnitude, a 1.5 percentage point increase in the state corporate income tax rate from a mean value of around 7 percent leads to approximately 37 percent of affected firms to file one fewer patent within the next two years, compared to a mean of about 9.1 patents per firm-year. </p>

         <p>Despite opponents attempts to suggest otherwise, there is reason to be confident that cutting the corporate tax rate will raise the wages of millions of workers. Progressive groups like Americans for Tax Fairness paint corporate tax cuts as a giveaway to wealthy corporations and their shareholders, which will reduce government revenues and, in time, lead to fewer government services for the poor. Yesterday, a WSJ/NBC poll found that 55 percent of Americans wanted to increase taxes on corporations and another 25 percent wanted to keep such taxes as they are. Its cost is ultimately borne by some combination of shareholders (through lower dividends or less valuable shares), workers (through lower wages), and consumers (through higher prices). Britain and Canada, in particular, have shown that it is possible to substantially cut rates without meaningfully reducing corporate revenues as a proportion of GDP. </p>

         <p>If they really care about helping workers and reducing poverty, they should rethink their opposition. Supporters of corporate-tax reform point out that the United States has one of the highest effective marginal corporate-tax rates in the world at 38.9 percent when both state and federal taxes are considered. Critics counter that the effective average corporate rate is actually much lower, with estimates ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent. The marginal tax rate reflects the amount of taxes that a company will pay on the next dollar of income earned, while the average effective tax rate is calculated based on the amount of taxes that companies actually pay after taking into account all exclusions and deductions. The administrations continuing refusal to embrace spending cuts means that it runs the risk of ballooning our $20 trillion national debt in pursuit of (sorely needed) tax cuts. </p>

         <b>www.cato.org</b>
         <p>The current method of taxing the profits of large, publicly traded corporations was designed for an economy in which international investment was relatively unimportant and most corporate profits were produced by tangible assets, such as machinery and buildings. As a result the United States should consider more significant reforms, such as leading an international effort to develop new rules to allocate corporate profits among countries or scrapping the corporate income tax entirely and replacing it with a direct tax on shareholders. By taxing corporate income at both the corporate and shareholder level, it encourages businesses to organize themselves as limited partnerships or subchapter S corporations so that they face only a single level of tax and favors sectors, such as agriculture and real estate, in which non-corporate structures have been prevalent. Depreciation rules and other special provisions favor investment in some industries over others for both taxable corporations and other businesses, causing capital to flow to less productive uses than they would with neutral tax rules. These rules encourage U. S., but not foreign-owned corporations, to retain profits overseas and may place U. S. companies at a disadvantage compared with their foreign competitors who do not pay home-country tax on their foreign profits. </p>

         <p>In this environment, business taxes  more specifically, corporate income taxes  are natural targets for legislative tax-raisers. Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980) drew attention to the possibility that using Harbergers (1962) celebrated tax incidence model, corporate income tax burdens might be borne more than 100% by workers, whose wages could fall so much in response to the reallocation of resources triggered by the corporate tax (reduced corporate output and greater non-corporate output) that owners of corporations actually could come out ahead. Comparing workers in states with tax rates above 9% to those in states with tax rates below 4%, the evidence is that union wage premiums are $1.88/hour higher in the low-tax states than in the high-tax states. Our first method compares workers in highly capital-intensive industries with those in less capital-intensive industries.

         <b>voxeu.org</b>
         <p>Eliminating the US corporate tax by, for example, taxing accrued global corporate profits as personal income can produce dramatic increases in US investment, output, real wages, and saving. For their part, many Republicans would applaud switching from wage to retail sales taxation, but would be appalled by wealth taxation. The difference between the 35% marginal effective US corporate tax rate, recently estimated by Mintz and Chen (2013), and the 13% average tax rate, suggested by the US National Income Accounts, tells us an important fact. Importantly, we also find substantial, if smaller, gains to US workers  particularly young and future workers  if other countries match the US and also eliminate their corporate income taxes. Concluding remarks Eliminating the corporate income tax could be implemented (http://www.thecommonsensetax.org/) as part of corporate tax integration in which shareholders are required to pay tax at the personal level on their shares of their companies profits as those profits accrue. </p>

         <p>At 35 percent, it is, nominally, higher than rates in other advanced economies  a factor that companies consider when they select where to invest. Reducing the corporate rate to 20 percent while dropping some deductions is one of Republican leaders top policy priorities: It is the bedrock underpinning a 429-page tax plan House Republicans announced on November 2, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It will also look at controversial pass-through taxation that critics of the Republican plan fear will be abused by the rich. Under the current tax code, the firm deducts the interest from its taxable income and pays tax only on $60 million  its profits after interest payments. If Washington wants to stop companies from taking advantage of tax-friendly environments overseas, or relocating altogether, it can start by making the United States a place where companies want to conduct business, wrote Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, after Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016. </p>
