  <h1>A Brief on income inequality</h1>
  
    <h2>Causes</h2>
    <h3><a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/dec08/w13982.html">The Causes of Rising Income Inequality</a></h3>
    <b>www.nber.org</b>
    <p>It's one of the biggest socioeconomic questions in America today: Why is income inequality rising in the United States, especially between the top 10 percent of workers and everybody else? There are gender differences in income inequality: between 1979 and 2005, for example, the income gap between women working for the median wage (the 50th percentile) and low-earning women (at the 10th percentile) grew much more than it did for men at those income levels during the same period. One study the authors cite suggests that the fall in organized labor's share of the workforce can explain 14 percent of the rise in the variance among male wages between 1973 and 2001 (but it had no apparent effect on the variance of female wages). They cite one study of 1,500 firms that found that the compensation earned by the top five corporate officers in 1993-5 equaled 5 percent of their firms' total profits during that period; by 2000-2, that ratio had more than doubled to 12.8 percent. America's CEOs have had their pay inflated by generous stock options and having their pay set by peers on corporate boards, the survey finds, as well as institutional differences between the United States and other nations, including such things as regulations, unions, and social norms. </p>
  
    <h2>Trade and globalization</h2>

    <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
    <p>Many people blame rising income inequality on the growing importance of trade, especially trade with nations in the developing world, in the past quarter century. More recently, Republican presidential aspirant Patrick Buchanan has called for an equalization tax on imports from third world countries to protect American workers against competition from Asian and Latin American workers who may be paid one-tenth the U. S. industrial wage. Earnings Inequality Even if trade is not to blame for trends in unearned income or changes in the composition of American households, it could still be an important source of growing wage inequality. When the data for men and women are combined, the earnings ratio in the most trade-affected industries rose 29 percent between 1969 and 1993exactly the same as the rise in inequality across all industries. Economic deregulation, new patterns of immigration into the United States, declining minimum wages, and the dwindling influence of labor unions have also contributed to the job woes of unskilled and semi-skilled workers. </p>

    <p>Changes to tax rates, including favorable treatment for capital gains, may also play a role. While many of the suspected drivers of rising income inequalityglobalization, technological change and the rising value of educationaffect other nations as well, few have seen as stark a rise in inequality as the United States. As the economy reached new heights in 2000, the poverty rate fell to 11.1 percenta rate not seen since 1973but in 2010 the poverty rate had risen to 15.1 percent. Among developed countries, only the United Kingdom has less class mobility than the United States; in 2006, the Brookings Institution found that 47 percent of U. S. parents income advantages are passed to their children, greater than in France (41 percent), Germany (32 percent) or Sweden (27 percent). Many of the presidents ideas concerned accelerating economic growth as a way to increase opportunity. </p>

To frame this in a different way, in contrast to earlier periods in our nations history, the economic growth experienced since 1975 has not translated into shared prosperity.

         <p>Executive Summary Economic inequality has risen to the top of the political agenda, championed by political candidates and best-selling authors alike. Although we are frequently told that we are living in a new Gilded Age, the U. S. economic system is already highly redistributive. Contrary to stereotypes, the wealthy tend to earn rather than inherit their wealth, and relatively few rich people work on Wall Street or in finance. Rather than reducing economic inequality, more government intervention may actually make the situation worse. Since policies to reduce inequality, such as increased taxes or additional social welfare programs, are likely to have unintended consequences that could cause more harm than good, we should instead focus on implementing policies that actually reduce poverty, rather than attacking inequality itself. </p>

         <b>voxeu.org</b>
         <p>In the bottom half of the distribution there is little evidence rising consumption inequality, and in the top half of the distribution the rise in consumption inequality has been much more modest than the rise in income inequality, particularly since 2000. President Obama called inequality the defining challenge of our time, while the Trump administration cites high inequality as motivation for changes in immigration and trade policy.1 The debate over inequality relies almost exclusively on income data that indicate that inequality has increased sharply in recent decades. Although income is the most common measure of the economic wellbeing of US households, there are a number of reasons why measuring how much people consume on food, shelter, transportation, and other goods and services provides a more accurate picture of their circumstances. There is considerable evidence that income is substantially under-reported in national surveys, especially for categories of income important for those with few resources, and the extent of under-reporting has increased over time (Meyer and Sullivan 2003, 2011a, Meyer et al. 2015, Bee and Mitchell 2017). [2] For studies of consumption inequality, see Johnson and Shipp (1997), Slesnick (2001), Krueger and Perri (2006), Heathcote et al. (2010), Attanasio et al. (2007), Attanasio et al.

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>Although Kentucky senator and GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul misleadingly blamed them for the high inequality present in their cities, many Democratic mayors have embraced tackling inequality as a framework for advancing a range of progressive policies on issues such as wages, education, and affordable housing. This analysis examines that ratio for each of the 100 largest U. S. metro areas, and the largest city in each of those metro areas, using new data from the 2014 American Community Survey (ACS).1 It also examines trends since 2007, before the onset of the Great Recession. Only 18 metro areas had inequality ratios exceeding the national average (they tend to be larger areas that pull up the overall average), while the same was true for 59 of the 97 largest cities in those metro areas. The Bridgeport areaequivalent to the New York suburb of Fairfield County, Conn.led the list, largely due to the very high incomes registered by its top earners (at least $560,000 for the top 5 percent of households).2 Two nearby metro areasGreater New York and New Havenalso landed in the top 10, as did Northeast neighbor Boston. In a simple linear regression that controls for the 20th percentile income in cities, the 95th percentile income in cities is positively and significantly associated with their 20th percentile rental costs. </p>

         <p>Authors This report updates a 2014 analysis that looked at levels of income inequality in the 50 largest U. S. cities, and examines in particular trends between 2012 and 2013, the most recent data available from the U. S. Census Bureau. Like the earlier analysis, it focuses on incomes among households near the top of the distributionthose earning more than 95 percent of all other householdsand households closer to the bottom of the distributionthose earning more than only 20 percent of all other households. Large cities remain more unequal by income than the nation overall In 2013, big cities continued to exhibit greater income disparities between rich and poor households than the rest of the country (Figure 1). In 12 cities, incomes for the 95th percentile of households in 2013 exceeded those in 2012 by a statistically significant margin. Income inequality rose in two cities and fell in four others from 2012 to 2013 How incomes change at the top and bottom of the distribution in a city dictates how its level of inequality, measured by the 95/20 income ratio, changes as well. </p>

         <b>journalistsresource.org</b>
         <p>Studies show that wealth distribution has become increasingly uneven over the last few decades because incomes grow much faster at the top end of the income range than in the middle or at the bottom end, according to a 2011 report by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Using 2011 figures, the Times notes, the difference in income between a household at the 50th percentile and a household at the 51st percentile is $1,237 ($42,327 versus $43,564). But the difference in incomes between a household at the 98th percentile and the 99th percentile is $146,118 ($360,435 versus $506,553). The study breaks social classes into four distinct groups: proprietors, who own the means of production and control the activities of others; managers, who do not own the means of production but do control the activities of others; workers, who control neither the means of production nor the activities of others; and independent producers, who own and operate small firms by themselves. Related research: While numerous studies have shown that Americans think the economic system is unfair and should be more egalitarian, a 2001 study sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that they do not support significant levels of wealth redistribution.

         <p>The conventional thinking among economists is that income inequality provides incentives for individuals to invest more in order to achieve the higher income position in society, but Kearney and Levine observe that if low-income youth view middle-class life as out of reach, they might decide to invest less in their own economic future. Related The authors focus on income inequality in the lower half of the income distribution, as measured by income gaps between the 10th and 50th percentiles of the income distribution rather than income gaps between the the top and bottom of the income distribution, which has been more of a focus in popular culture. One-quarter or more of those who start high school in the higher inequality states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and the District Columbia fail to graduate in a four-year period, as compared to only around 10 percent in Vermont, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Nebraskalower inequality states. Their econometric analysis goes on to show that low-income youthboys in particularare 4.1 percentage points more likely to drop out of high school by age 20 if they live in a high-inequality location relative to those who live in a low-inequality location. They also highlight other research showing that the overwhelming majority of 9th graders aspire to go to college, but by 11th grade, low-SES students are substantially less likely to expect they will enroll in college, even among those students with high test scores. </p>

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>Many people blame rising income inequality on the growing importance of trade, especially trade with nations in the developing world, in the past quarter century. More recently, Republican presidential aspirant Patrick Buchanan has called for an equalization tax on imports from third world countries to protect American workers against competition from Asian and Latin American workers who may be paid one-tenth the U. S. industrial wage. Earnings Inequality Even if trade is not to blame for trends in unearned income or changes in the composition of American households, it could still be an important source of growing wage inequality. When the data for men and women are combined, the earnings ratio in the most trade-affected industries rose 29 percent between 1969 and 1993exactly the same as the rise in inequality across all industries. Economic deregulation, new patterns of immigration into the United States, declining minimum wages, and the dwindling influence of labor unions have also contributed to the job woes of unskilled and semi-skilled workers. </p>

Rather than reducing economic inequality, more government intervention may actually make the situation worse.

         <b>voxeu.org</b>
         <p>In the bottom half of the distribution there is little evidence rising consumption inequality, and in the top half of the distribution the rise in consumption inequality has been much more modest than the rise in income inequality, particularly since 2000. President Obama called inequality the defining challenge of our time, while the Trump administration cites high inequality as motivation for changes in immigration and trade policy.1 The debate over inequality relies almost exclusively on income data that indicate that inequality has increased sharply in recent decades. Although income is the most common measure of the economic wellbeing of US households, there are a number of reasons why measuring how much people consume on food, shelter, transportation, and other goods and services provides a more accurate picture of their circumstances. There is considerable evidence that income is substantially under-reported in national surveys, especially for categories of income important for those with few resources, and the extent of under-reporting has increased over time (Meyer and Sullivan 2003, 2011a, Meyer et al. 2015, Bee and Mitchell 2017). [2] For studies of consumption inequality, see Johnson and Shipp (1997), Slesnick (2001), Krueger and Perri (2006), Heathcote et al. (2010), Attanasio et al. (2007), Attanasio et al.

         <p>The team shows that measuring income by tax declarations alone is misleading  since so many people dodge their taxes  and that income inequality in many countries is far worse than previously thought. In the first paper, Who Owns the Wealth in Tax Havens? Macro Evidence and Implications for Global Inequality, researchers use statistics released for the first time in 2016 by the Bank for International Settlements  the Basel-based arbiter for central banks  to estimate global offshore wealth for each country. These data show, for example, the total deposits of French nationals in Hong Kong or Kazakh citizens in the British Virgin Islands and date back to the early 2000s. Building on a 2013 paper by Zucman, the team estimates that the equivalent of almost 10 percent of global economic output  or $5.6 trillion in 2007  is held offshore, where it is out of the taxmans sights. The share of wealth owned by the top 0.01 percent in the U. S. has reached levels last seen in Europe when the continent was ruled by emperors. </p>

         <b>www.nber.org</b>
         <p>It's one of the biggest socioeconomic questions in America today: Why is income inequality rising in the United States, especially between the top 10 percent of workers and everybody else? There are gender differences in income inequality: between 1979 and 2005, for example, the income gap between women working for the median wage (the 50th percentile) and low-earning women (at the 10th percentile) grew much more than it did for men at those income levels during the same period. One study the authors cite suggests that the fall in organized labor's share of the workforce can explain 14 percent of the rise in the variance among male wages between 1973 and 2001 (but it had no apparent effect on the variance of female wages). They cite one study of 1,500 firms that found that the compensation earned by the top five corporate officers in 1993-5 equaled 5 percent of their firms' total profits during that period; by 2000-2, that ratio had more than doubled to 12.8 percent. America's CEOs have had their pay inflated by generous stock options and having their pay set by peers on corporate boards, the survey finds, as well as institutional differences between the United States and other nations, including such things as regulations, unions, and social norms. </p>

         <p>Authors This report updates a 2014 analysis that looked at levels of income inequality in the 50 largest U.

Like the earlier analysis, it focuses on incomes among households near the top of the distributionthose earning more than 95 percent of all other householdsand households closer to the bottom of the distributionthose earning more than only 20 percent of all other households. Large cities remain more unequal by income than the nation overall In 2013, big cities continued to exhibit greater income disparities between rich and poor households than the rest of the country (Figure 1). In 12 cities, incomes for the 95th percentile of households in 2013 exceeded those in 2012 by a statistically significant margin. Income inequality rose in two cities and fell in four others from 2012 to 2013 How incomes change at the top and bottom of the distribution in a city dictates how its level of inequality, measured by the 95/20 income ratio, changes as well. </p>

         <p>Abstract This paper reviews historical trends in economic inequality and tax policys role in reducing it. It documents the various reasons why income inequality continues to rise, paying particular attention to the interplay between regressive and progressive federal and state taxes. The report also considers the trade-off between the social welfare gains that a more equal distribution of incomes would provide, and the economic costs of using the tax system to reduce inequality, highlighting the fact that income inequality reflects an amalgam of factors. The optimal policy response reflects that complexity.

         <p>The share of total income earned by the top 1 percent of families was less than 10 percent in the late 1970s but now exceeds 20 percent as of the end of 2012. Income tax data exists since 1913the first year the country collected federal income taxbut there is no comparable tax on wealth to provide information on the distribution of assets. Currently available measures of wealth inequality rely either on surveys (the Survey of Consumer Finances of the Federal Reserve Board), on estate tax return data, or on lists of wealthy individuals, such as the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans. The trend then inverted, with the share of total household wealth owned by the top 0.1 percent increasing to 22 percent in 2012 from 7 percent in the late 1970s. For the bottom 90 percent of families, real wage gains (after factoring in inflation) were very limited over the past three decades, but for their counterparts in the top 1 percent real wages grew fast. </p>

         <b>journalistsresource.org</b>
         <p>Studies show that wealth distribution has become increasingly uneven over the last few decades because incomes grow much faster at the top end of the income range than in the middle or at the bottom end, according to a 2011 report by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Using 2011 figures, the Times notes, the difference in income between a household at the 50th percentile and a household at the 51st percentile is $1,237 ($42,327 versus $43,564). But the difference in incomes between a household at the 98th percentile and the 99th percentile is $146,118 ($360,435 versus $506,553). The study breaks social classes into four distinct groups: proprietors, who own the means of production and control the activities of others; managers, who do not own the means of production but do control the activities of others; workers, who control neither the means of production nor the activities of others; and independent producers, who own and operate small firms by themselves. Related research: While numerous studies have shown that Americans think the economic system is unfair and should be more egalitarian, a 2001 study sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that they do not support significant levels of wealth redistribution.

         <p>The conventional thinking among economists is that income inequality provides incentives for individuals to invest more in order to achieve the higher income position in society, but Kearney and Levine observe that if low-income youth view middle-class life as out of reach, they might decide to invest less in their own economic future. Related The authors focus on income inequality in the lower half of the income distribution, as measured by income gaps between the 10th and 50th percentiles of the income distribution rather than income gaps between the the top and bottom of the income distribution, which has been more of a focus in popular culture. One-quarter or more of those who start high school in the higher inequality states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and the District Columbia fail to graduate in a four-year period, as compared to only around 10 percent in Vermont, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Nebraskalower inequality states. Their econometric analysis goes on to show that low-income youthboys in particularare 4.1 percentage points more likely to drop out of high school by age 20 if they live in a high-inequality location relative to those who live in a low-inequality location. They also highlight other research showing that the overwhelming majority of 9th graders aspire to go to college, but by 11th grade, low-SES students are substantially less likely to expect they will enroll in college, even among those students with high test scores. </p>

To frame this in a different way, in contrast to earlier periods in our nations history, the economic growth experienced since 1975 has not translated into shared prosperity. This was a period of strong economic growth in which the growth in family income was roughly the same across the income distribution  families in the bottom 20 percent saw their income grow by 90 percent, as compared to 86 percent for families in the top five percent.

America's CEOs have had their pay inflated by generous stock options and having their pay set by peers on corporate boards, the survey finds, as well as institutional differences between the United States and other nations, including such things as regulations, unions, and social norms. </p>

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>Many people blame rising income inequality on the growing importance of trade, especially trade with nations in the developing world, in the past quarter century. More recently, Republican presidential aspirant Patrick Buchanan has called for an equalization tax on imports from third world countries to protect American workers against competition from Asian and Latin American workers who may be paid one-tenth the U. S. industrial wage. Earnings Inequality Even if trade is not to blame for trends in unearned income or changes in the composition of American households, it could still be an important source of growing wage inequality. When the data for men and women are combined, the earnings ratio in the most trade-affected industries rose 29 percent between 1969 and 1993exactly the same as the rise in inequality across all industries. Economic deregulation, new patterns of immigration into the United States, declining minimum wages, and the dwindling influence of labor unions have also contributed to the job woes of unskilled and semi-skilled workers. </p>

         <p>Abstract This paper reviews historical trends in economic inequality and tax policys role in reducing it. It documents the various reasons why income inequality continues to rise, paying particular attention to the interplay between regressive and progressive federal and state taxes. The report also considers the trade-off between the social welfare gains that a more equal distribution of incomes would provide, and the economic costs of using the tax system to reduce inequality, highlighting the fact that income inequality reflects an amalgam of factors. The optimal policy response reflects that complexity.

         <p>The share of total income earned by the top 1 percent of families was less than 10 percent in the late 1970s but now exceeds 20 percent as of the end of 2012. Income tax data exists since 1913the first year the country collected federal income taxbut there is no comparable tax on wealth to provide information on the distribution of assets. Currently available measures of wealth inequality rely either on surveys (the Survey of Consumer Finances of the Federal Reserve Board), on estate tax return data, or on lists of wealthy individuals, such as the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans. The trend then inverted, with the share of total household wealth owned by the top 0.1 percent increasing to 22 percent in 2012 from 7 percent in the late 1970s. For the bottom 90 percent of families, real wage gains (after factoring in inflation) were very limited over the past three decades, but for their counterparts in the top 1 percent real wages grew fast. </p>

         <b>journalistsresource.org</b>
         <p>Studies show that wealth distribution has become increasingly uneven over the last few decades because incomes grow much faster at the top end of the income range than in the middle or at the bottom end, according to a 2011 report by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Using 2011 figures, the Times notes, the difference in income between a household at the 50th percentile and a household at the 51st percentile is $1,237 ($42,327 versus $43,564). But the difference in incomes between a household at the 98th percentile and the 99th percentile is $146,118 ($360,435 versus $506,553). The study breaks social classes into four distinct groups: proprietors, who own the means of production and control the activities of others; managers, who do not own the means of production but do control the activities of others; workers, who control neither the means of production nor the activities of others; and independent producers, who own and operate small firms by themselves. Related research: While numerous studies have shown that Americans think the economic system is unfair and should be more egalitarian, a 2001 study sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that they do not support significant levels of wealth redistribution.

         <p>The conventional thinking among economists is that income inequality provides incentives for individuals to invest more in order to achieve the higher income position in society, but Kearney and Levine observe that if low-income youth view middle-class life as out of reach, they might decide to invest less in their own economic future. Related The authors focus on income inequality in the lower half of the income distribution, as measured by income gaps between the 10th and 50th percentiles of the income distribution rather than income gaps between the the top and bottom of the income distribution, which has been more of a focus in popular culture. One-quarter or more of those who start high school in the higher inequality states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and the District Columbia fail to graduate in a four-year period, as compared to only around 10 percent in Vermont, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Nebraskalower inequality states. Their econometric analysis goes on to show that low-income youthboys in particularare 4.1 percentage points more likely to drop out of high school by age 20 if they live in a high-inequality location relative to those who live in a low-inequality location. They also highlight other research showing that the overwhelming majority of 9th graders aspire to go to college, but by 11th grade, low-SES students are substantially less likely to expect they will enroll in college, even among those students with high test scores. </p>

         <p>In the bottom half of the distribution there is little evidence rising consumption inequality, and in the top half of the distribution the rise in consumption inequality has been much more modest than the rise in income inequality, particularly since 2000. President Obama called inequality the defining challenge of our time, while the Trump administration cites high inequality as motivation for changes in immigration and trade policy.1 The debate over inequality relies almost exclusively on income data that indicate that inequality has increased sharply in recent decades. Although income is the most common measure of the economic wellbeing of US households, there are a number of reasons why measuring how much people consume on food, shelter, transportation, and other goods and services provides a more accurate picture of their circumstances. There is considerable evidence that income is substantially under-reported in national surveys, especially for categories of income important for those with few resources, and the extent of under-reporting has increased over time (Meyer and Sullivan 2003, 2011a, Meyer et al. 2015, Bee and Mitchell 2017).

Some crucial findings of the new study may come as a surprise, especially to people who believe incomes of the poor and middle class have stagnated since the turn of the century while incomes at the top have soared. Since 2000 pre-tax and after-tax incomes have improved among Americans in the bottom 90% of the income distribution. The pre- and post-tax incomes of the top 1% improved in 2010 compared with 2009 while incomes in the bottom 90% of households remained essentially flat. Income reports published by the IRS suggest this trend continued in 2011 and 2012, when the most affluent taxpayers continued to enjoy big income gains. </p>

         <p>It's one of the biggest socioeconomic questions in America today: Why is income inequality rising in the United States, especially between the top 10 percent of workers and everybody else? There are gender differences in income inequality: between 1979 and 2005, for example, the income gap between women working for the median wage (the 50th percentile) and low-earning women (at the 10th percentile) grew much more than it did for men at those income levels during the same period. One study the authors cite suggests that the fall in organized labor's share of the workforce can explain 14 percent of the rise in the variance among male wages between 1973 and 2001 (but it had no apparent effect on the variance of female wages). They cite one study of 1,500 firms that found that the compensation earned by the top five corporate officers in 1993-5 equaled 5 percent of their firms' total profits during that period; by 2000-2, that ratio had more than doubled to 12.8 percent. America's CEOs have had their pay inflated by generous stock options and having their pay set by peers on corporate boards, the survey finds, as well as institutional differences between the United States and other nations, including such things as regulations, unions, and social norms. </p>

         <p>The share of total income earned by the top 1 percent of families was less than 10 percent in the late 1970s but now exceeds 20 percent as of the end of 2012. Income tax data exists since 1913the first year the country collected federal income taxbut there is no comparable tax on wealth to provide information on the distribution of assets. Currently available measures of wealth inequality rely either on surveys (the Survey of Consumer Finances of the Federal Reserve Board), on estate tax return data, or on lists of wealthy individuals, such as the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans. The trend then inverted, with the share of total household wealth owned by the top 0.1 percent increasing to 22 percent in 2012 from 7 percent in the late 1970s. For the bottom 90 percent of families, real wage gains (after factoring in inflation) were very limited over the past three decades, but for their counterparts in the top 1 percent real wages grew fast. </p>

         <p>Studies show that wealth distribution has become increasingly uneven over the last few decades because incomes grow much faster at the top end of the income range than in the middle or at the bottom end, according to a 2011 report by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Using 2011 figures, the Times notes, the difference in income between a household at the 50th percentile and a household at the 51st percentile is $1,237 ($42,327 versus $43,564). But the difference in incomes between a household at the 98th percentile and the 99th percentile is $146,118 ($360,435 versus $506,553). The study breaks social classes into four distinct groups: proprietors, who own the means of production and control the activities of others; managers, who do not own the means of production but do control the activities of others; workers, who control neither the means of production nor the activities of others; and independent producers, who own and operate small firms by themselves. Related research: While numerous studies have shown that Americans think the economic system is unfair and should be more egalitarian, a 2001 study sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that they do not support significant levels of wealth redistribution.

         <p>In the bottom half of the distribution there is little evidence rising consumption inequality, and in the top half of the distribution the rise in consumption inequality has been much more modest than the rise in income inequality, particularly since 2000. President Obama called inequality the defining challenge of our time, while the Trump administration cites high inequality as motivation for changes in immigration and trade policy.1 The debate over inequality relies almost exclusively on income data that indicate that inequality has increased sharply in recent decades. Although income is the most common measure of the economic wellbeing of US households, there are a number of reasons why measuring how much people consume on food, shelter, transportation, and other goods and services provides a more accurate picture of their circumstances. There is considerable evidence that income is substantially under-reported in national surveys, especially for categories of income important for those with few resources, and the extent of under-reporting has increased over time (Meyer and Sullivan 2003, 2011a, Meyer et al. 2015, Bee and Mitchell 2017).

         <b>journalistsresource.org</b>
         <p>The team shows that measuring income by tax declarations alone is misleading  since so many people dodge their taxes  and that income inequality in many countries is far worse than previously thought. In the first paper, Who Owns the Wealth in Tax Havens? Macro Evidence and Implications for Global Inequality, researchers use statistics released for the first time in 2016 by the Bank for International Settlements  the Basel-based arbiter for central banks  to estimate global offshore wealth for each country. These data show, for example, the total deposits of French nationals in Hong Kong or Kazakh citizens in the British Virgin Islands and date back to the early 2000s. Building on a 2013 paper by Zucman, the team estimates that the equivalent of almost 10 percent of global economic output  or $5.6 trillion in 2007  is held offshore, where it is out of the taxmans sights. The share of wealth owned by the top 0.01 percent in the U. S. has reached levels last seen in Europe when the continent was ruled by emperors. </p>

         <p>Although Kentucky senator and GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul misleadingly blamed them for the high inequality present in their cities, many Democratic mayors have embraced tackling inequality as a framework for advancing a range of progressive policies on issues such as wages, education, and affordable housing. This analysis examines that ratio for each of the 100 largest U. S. metro areas, and the largest city in each of those metro areas, using new data from the 2014 American Community Survey (ACS).1 It also examines trends since 2007, before the onset of the Great Recession. Only 18 metro areas had inequality ratios exceeding the national average (they tend to be larger areas that pull up the overall average), while the same was true for 59 of the 97 largest cities in those metro areas. The Bridgeport areaequivalent to the New York suburb of Fairfield County, Conn.led the list, largely due to the very high incomes registered by its top earners (at least $560,000 for the top 5 percent of households).2 Two nearby metro areasGreater New York and New Havenalso landed in the top 10, as did Northeast neighbor Boston. In a simple linear regression that controls for the 20th percentile income in cities, the 95th percentile income in cities is positively and significantly associated with their 20th percentile rental costs. </p>

         <p>Authors This report updates a 2014 analysis that looked at levels of income inequality in the 50 largest U.

Like the earlier analysis, it focuses on incomes among households near the top of the distributionthose earning more than 95 percent of all other householdsand households closer to the bottom of the distributionthose earning more than only 20 percent of all other households. Large cities remain more unequal by income than the nation overall In 2013, big cities continued to exhibit greater income disparities between rich and poor households than the rest of the country (Figure 1). In 12 cities, incomes for the 95th percentile of households in 2013 exceeded those in 2012 by a statistically significant margin. Income inequality rose in two cities and fell in four others from 2012 to 2013 How incomes change at the top and bottom of the distribution in a city dictates how its level of inequality, measured by the 95/20 income ratio, changes as well. </p>

         <p>The conventional thinking among economists is that income inequality provides incentives for individuals to invest more in order to achieve the higher income position in society, but Kearney and Levine observe that if low-income youth view middle-class life as out of reach, they might decide to invest less in their own economic future. Related The authors focus on income inequality in the lower half of the income distribution, as measured by income gaps between the 10th and 50th percentiles of the income distribution rather than income gaps between the the top and bottom of the income distribution, which has been more of a focus in popular culture. One-quarter or more of those who start high school in the higher inequality states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and the District Columbia fail to graduate in a four-year period, as compared to only around 10 percent in Vermont, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Nebraskalower inequality states. Their econometric analysis goes on to show that low-income youthboys in particularare 4.1 percentage points more likely to drop out of high school by age 20 if they live in a high-inequality location relative to those who live in a low-inequality location. They also highlight other research showing that the overwhelming majority of 9th graders aspire to go to college, but by 11th grade, low-SES students are substantially less likely to expect they will enroll in college, even among those students with high test scores. </p>

         <p>As you are aware, as this is the topic of todays hearing, inequality has increased dramatically in the United States during recent decades. To frame this in a different way, in contrast to earlier periods in our nations history, the economic growth experienced since 1975 has not translated into shared prosperity. This was a period of strong economic growth in which the growth in family income was roughly the same across the income distribution  families in the bottom 20 percent saw their income grow by 90 percent, as compared to 86 percent for families in the top five percent. If those at the bottom of the income distribution view middle class life as increasingly out of reach, they might forgo the mainstream climb to economic success, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and inequality. I will now expand briefly on these three main points, all of which lead me to the conclusion that it is of the utmost urgency that we make the necessary investments so that all Americans have the skills and ability to compete in a global labor market. </p>

         <p>They also predicted 2013 tax burdens based on projections of income combined with a careful reading of current tax law. Some crucial findings of the new study may come as a surprise, especially to people who believe incomes of the poor and middle class have stagnated since the turn of the century while incomes at the top have soared. Since 2000 pre-tax and after-tax incomes have improved among Americans in the bottom 90% of the income distribution. The pre- and post-tax incomes of the top 1% improved in 2010 compared with 2009 while incomes in the bottom 90% of households remained essentially flat. Income reports published by the IRS suggest this trend continued in 2011 and 2012, when the most affluent taxpayers continued to enjoy big income gains. </p>

         <p>Abstract This paper reviews historical trends in economic inequality and tax policys role in reducing it. It documents the various reasons why income inequality continues to rise, paying particular attention to the interplay between regressive and progressive federal and state taxes. The report also considers the trade-off between the social welfare gains that a more equal distribution of incomes would provide, and the economic costs of using the tax system to reduce inequality, highlighting the fact that income inequality reflects an amalgam of factors.

         <p>Changes to tax rates, including favorable treatment for capital gains, may also play a role. While many of the suspected drivers of rising income inequalityglobalization, technological change and the rising value of educationaffect other nations as well, few have seen as stark a rise in inequality as the United States. As the economy reached new heights in 2000, the poverty rate fell to 11.1 percenta rate not seen since 1973but in 2010 the poverty rate had risen to 15.1 percent. Among developed countries, only the United Kingdom has less class mobility than the United States; in 2006, the Brookings Institution found that 47 percent of U. S. parents income advantages are passed to their children, greater than in France (41 percent), Germany (32 percent) or Sweden (27 percent). Many of the presidents ideas concerned accelerating economic growth as a way to increase opportunity. </p>

         <p>Executive Summary Economic inequality has risen to the top of the political agenda, championed by political candidates and best-selling authors alike. Although we are frequently told that we are living in a new Gilded Age, the U. S. economic system is already highly redistributive. Contrary to stereotypes, the wealthy tend to earn rather than inherit their wealth, and relatively few rich people work on Wall Street or in finance. Rather than reducing economic inequality, more government intervention may actually make the situation worse. Since policies to reduce inequality, such as increased taxes or additional social welfare programs, are likely to have unintended consequences that could cause more harm than good, we should instead focus on implementing policies that actually reduce poverty, rather than attacking inequality itself. </p>

         <p>In the bottom half of the distribution there is little evidence rising consumption inequality, and in the top half of the distribution the rise in consumption inequality has been much more modest than the rise in income inequality, particularly since 2000. President Obama called inequality the defining challenge of our time, while the Trump administration cites high inequality as motivation for changes in immigration and trade policy.1 The debate over inequality relies almost exclusively on income data that indicate that inequality has increased sharply in recent decades. Although income is the most common measure of the economic wellbeing of US households, there are a number of reasons why measuring how much people consume on food, shelter, transportation, and other goods and services provides a more accurate picture of their circumstances. There is considerable evidence that income is substantially under-reported in national surveys, especially for categories of income important for those with few resources, and the extent of under-reporting has increased over time (Meyer and Sullivan 2003, 2011a, Meyer et al. 2015, Bee and Mitchell 2017).

         <p>Not only has income inequality in Australia grown over the past two decades, rich and poor are also more segregated in terms of where they live in the big cities. The corporate world must embrace human rights as a fundamental business priority. Editors note: The state of the union is good, and the attitude of President Barack Obama in his annual speech to Congress was upbeat.

         <b>journalistsresource.org</b>
         <p>The team shows that measuring income by tax declarations alone is misleading  since so many people dodge their taxes  and that income inequality in many countries is far worse than previously thought. In the first paper, Who Owns the Wealth in Tax Havens? Macro Evidence and Implications for Global Inequality, researchers use statistics released for the first time in 2016 by the Bank for International Settlements  the Basel-based arbiter for central banks  to estimate global offshore wealth for each country. These data show, for example, the total deposits of French nationals in Hong Kong or Kazakh citizens in the British Virgin Islands and date back to the early 2000s. Building on a 2013 paper by Zucman, the team estimates that the equivalent of almost 10 percent of global economic output  or $5.6 trillion in 2007  is held offshore, where it is out of the taxmans sights. The share of wealth owned by the top 0.01 percent in the U. S. has reached levels last seen in Europe when the continent was ruled by emperors. </p>

         <p>Studies show that wealth distribution has become increasingly uneven over the last few decades because incomes grow much faster at the top end of the income range than in the middle or at the bottom end, according to a 2011 report by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Using 2011 figures, the Times notes, the difference in income between a household at the 50th percentile and a household at the 51st percentile is $1,237 ($42,327 versus $43,564). But the difference in incomes between a household at the 98th percentile and the 99th percentile is $146,118 ($360,435 versus $506,553). The study breaks social classes into four distinct groups: proprietors, who own the means of production and control the activities of others; managers, who do not own the means of production but do control the activities of others; workers, who control neither the means of production nor the activities of others; and independent producers, who own and operate small firms by themselves. Related research: While numerous studies have shown that Americans think the economic system is unfair and should be more egalitarian, a 2001 study sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that they do not support significant levels of wealth redistribution.
