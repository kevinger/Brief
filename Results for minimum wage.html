    <b>www.cato.org</b>
    <p>As the worldwide economic slump drags on, the political drumbeat to either introduce minimum wage laws (read: Germany) or increase the minimums in countries where these laws exist  such as Indonesia  is becoming deafening. There are seven European Union (E.U.) countries in which no minimum wage is mandated (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, and Sweden). This point is even more pronounced when we look at rates of unemployment among the E. U.s youth  defined as those younger than 25 years of age (see the accompanying chart). Those data also show that the probability of an unemployed worker finding employment increases dramatically the closer an unemployed worker comes to the termination date for receipt of his unemployment benefits. In short, when the prospect of losing welfare benefits raises its head, unemployed workers magically tend to find work. </p>

    <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
    <p>When labor unions and activists began calling for an increase in Americas minimum wage to $15 an hour, many thought it was a typical bargaining ploy, and that they would be pleased to receive much more modest increases. Many economists worry minimum wage increases tend to reduce employment, hurting young and less-educated workers the most. In a Congressional Budget Office report last year, policy analysts predicted that Obamas proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour would raise wages for 16 to 24 million people while eliminating about half a million jobs  a reasonable tradeoff worth embracing, in my view. We should also expand the Earned Income Tax Credits for childless adults, paid parental leave (funded by payroll taxes rather than mandates on employers), and education and training efforts for workers with low skills to better prepare them for good-paying jobs. We should work with employers to help them expand apprenticeships and other opportunities for workers to learn while they earn, and to generate better pathways from high school and community colleges into high-paying jobs. </p>

    <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
    <p>Calls for minimum wage increasesat the federal, state, and local levelsare based on the premise that rises in the minimum wage will improve the economic well-being of low-paid workers. The argument that only a small share of workers is actually paid the minimum wage misses a key point: many of those who would be impacted by a raise in the minimum wage are actually low-wage workers making slightly above the minimum wage. Among those earning less than $10 an hour, only 12 percent were teenagers, as compared to 26 percent in 1979. Considering that near-minimum wage workers would also be affected, we find that an increase could raise the wages of up to 35 million workersthats 29.4 percent of the workforce. We also continue to explore the nations jobs gap, or the number of jobs needed to return to pre-recession employment levels. </p>

    <h2>Poverty</h2>

    <b>www.cato.org</b>
    <p>Sabias own statistical research with economist Richard Burkhauser found no evidence that minimum wage increases were effective at reducing overall poverty rates or poverty rates among workers. A study by economists David Neumark and William Wascher found that while some poor workers who kept their jobs after minimum wage increases were lifted out of poverty, others lost their jobs and fell into poverty. The first reason is that minimum wages reduce the work available for low-skill workers:Many firms respond to minimum wage increases by substituting away from low-skilled labor and toward other inputs. Estimates of the employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage for low-skilled individuals generally range from -0.1 to as large as -0.3, suggesting that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces low-skilled employment by 1 to 3 percent. We find that only 13 percent of workers who would be affected live in poor households, while nearly two-thirds live in households with incomes over twice the poverty line, and over 40 percent live in households with incomes over three times the poverty line. </p>
  
    <h2>Unions</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cato.org/joining-the-minimum-wage-debate">The Minimum Wage Debate</a></h3>
    <b>www.cato.org</b>
    <p>President Obama has made raising the minimum wage a centerpiece of his campaign against "income inequality." In his most recent State of the Union Address, he called for raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour over the next 3 years. Numerous governors are also pushing to increase their state minimum as well. No doubt such proposals are politically popular. On the other hand it would almost certainly reduce employment opportunities, especially for those low skilled, entry level workers for whom a job represents the first rungs on the ladder of opportunity. </p>

         <b>journalistsresource.org</b>
         <p>Raising the minimum wage results in lower teen birth rates, especially among white and Hispanic adolescents, a new study suggests. Much of the newest research focuses on how it may influence peoples health. A 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, for example, indicates that raising the minimum wage to $15 in New York City would have prevented as many as 5,500 premature deaths between 2008 and 2012. A 2016 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests a higher minimum wage is associated with higher infant birth weights and a decline in smoking during pregnancy. A $1 increase yields about 0.49 fewer births per 1,000 Hispanic teen girls, compared to 0.11 fewer births per 1,000 white, non-Hispanic teen girls. </p>

         <p>Results show that Chinese low-income households fully spend their incremental income, with no differences in consumption behaviour across more or less financially constrained households. In this column, we present new research on the impact of Chinas minimum wage policy on consumption spending of Chinese households during the period 2002-2009 (Dautovic et al. 2017). First, higher minimum wages may simply substitute for other social transfers, which attenuates any effective income increase. For the period 2002-2009, we identify more than 13,874 changes in the local minimum wage across China's 2,183 counties and 285 cities, and match them to the urban household survey (UHS) which covers 73,164 urban household-year observations. We identify yearly minimum wage increases at the county level relative to the province level, and sort all household observations into 40 (equally large) bins based on the relative local minimum wage increase. </p>

         <p>He notes that the loss in cash and noncash transfers and tax credits among those who would benefit the most from minimum wage increases is likely to dampen some of the benefits, especially among those around the poverty line, yet the resulting public savings could be ploughed back into further shoring up the safety netin turn further increasing the complementarity between minimum wages and income support for raising the incomes of families at the bottom of the income ladder. He notes that typically, eligibility for supplemental nutrition assistance, for example, requires income to be less than 130 percent of the federal poverty threshold, which for this population binds just under the 15th percentile. On average, those in the bottom quartile of the income distribution can expect an approximately $525 increase in annual income from the minimum-wage policy; the gains are largest around the 15th percentile. Between 1979 and 2012, the declining minimum wage was responsible for 48 percent of the increase in female wage inequality between the bottom and middle of the wage distribution. Figure 4 Zipperer and his co-authors show that this map divides states into two groups: states with high average minimum wages and states with low average minimum wages during the 19792014 period. Congress should also take care to make sure that other benefits for low-wage workers provide a full package for low-wage workers and their families, as families will also need help with access to affordable and quality health care, childcare, and housing, even at a higher minimum wage. </p>

         <p>The minimum wage has recently reentered the forefront of policy discourse, with federal proposals ranging from leaving the minimum wage as it is or increasing it to $10.10 or even $15 per hour. Second, lower-rated restaurants are disproportionately affected by minimum-wage increases. In other words, the impact of the minimum wage on exit is more pronounced among lower-rated restaurants. The restaurant industry in the Bay Area makes a compelling setting to investigate the impact of the minimum wage on small businesses. Third, while we were interested in changes at the local level, looking at different types of businesses, the public-facing versions of the Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data are rolled up to the county or Zip Code level. </p>

         <p>A University of Washington study released Monday indicates that the move from an $11-per-hour minimum wage to a $13-per-hour minimum wage in Seattle was associated with a more-than-9% cut in low-wage workers hours. Good intentions aside, compelling new research suggests Seattles minimum-wage law harmed poor workers significantly. The larger effect may also be because the wage increase was relatively large and phased in quickly (an 18% increase in just one year, 37% in two) or because it was implemented at the city level. If employees in these groups are not subject to the wage increase then the estimates are biased, looking like the policy had no impact. In the meantime, good intentions dont change bad news. </p>

         <p>This column examines the impact of the more recent state increases on wages, weekly earnings, and employment among workers in the low-wage leisure and hospitality Industry. In 2015 real income of households at the 10th percentile of the income distribution grew 7.9%  the fastest growth since 1968. A new analysis by President Obamas Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that minimum wage increases implemented over the past three years by 18 states and the District of Columbia have also contributed to substantial increases in average wages for workers in low-wage jobs, helping to reverse a pattern of stagnant or falling real wages in the preceding years. Average wages and weekly earnings for those who work in the lowest paid jobs are at least 6.6% higher in these states than they would have been in the absence of these policy changes, based on a conservative counterfactual. The figure shows a slight downward trend prior to 2014 in the states that ultimately raised their minimum wages, while wages were growing, albeit at a slow pace, in the other group of states. </p>

         <p>Many cities are also boosting low-income workers pay, among them Oakland, CA, which increased its minimum wage to $12.25 an hour, and Seattle, WA, which now requires large employers to pay at least $11.00 an hour. In addition to minimum wage workers who receive a direct increase, which portions of the workforce receive indirect raises from a minimum wage increase? Although the minimum wages enhances the bargaining power of many low-wage workers, an increased minimum wages effectiveness in doing so dissipates as it spreads across the wage spectrum, essentially disappearing for middle-class wage earners. Assessing the exact impact of raising the minimum wage on specific earners may require higher-quality hourly wage data on all workers than is currently available in standard household surveys in the United States. Using employer-reported data in the United Kingdom that may be more accurate than U. S. household survey data, Richard Dickens of the University of Sussex and Alan Manning and Tim Butcher of the UK Low Pay Commission find that although the minimum wage only affected the bottom 5 percent of the wage distribution, ripple effects extended to the 25th percentile. </p>

The Economics The new letter claims that  the weight of evidence now show[s] that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers  . Here is the abstract:We review the burgeoning literature on the employment effects of minimum wages - in the United States and other countries - that was spurred by the new minimum wage research beginning in the early 1990s. If you accept as a fact that a minimum wage of $57.25 would reduce employment, and you accept as a fact that some workers are currently paid $7.25 per hour, then logic compels you to believe that a small increase in the minimum wage above $7.25 will have at least a small negative effect on employment. Will those advocating a higher minimum wage be willing meet face to face with disadvantaged members of society, who are willing and able to work, and explain why their employment needs to be sacrificed for higher wages for those who remain employed? </p>

         <p>Share On August 19, the Cato Institute released a study by me and Charles Hughes, The Work vs. Welfare Trade-Off, 2013: An Analysis of the Total Level of Welfare Benefits by State, showing that a family collecting welfare benefits from seven common programs  Temporary assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, Medicaid, WIC, public housing assistance, utilities assistance (LIHEAP) and free commodities  could receive more than what a minimum wage job would pay in 35 states. Attempts to simply mandate that businesses pay more, through increased minimum wages or living wage laws, as well as attempts to mandate employee benefits like health insurance (see Obamacare), primarily result in fewer jobs. The amount of compensation a worker receives is more or less a function of his or her productivity. More recently, Michael Hicks of Ball State University looked at the impact of the July 2008 minimum wage increase on unemployment rates in the United States and concluded that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage results in a roughly 0.19 percent increase in unemployment, meaning the loss of about 160,000 jobs. Greater prosperity eventually finds its way into higher wages for workers, including those at the bottom of the ladder. </p>

         <p>In a 2014 letter written by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) to President Obama and congressional leaders in support of an increase in the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, more than 600 economists apparently agreed with, and endorsed this statement:Research suggests that a minimum-wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth, and providing some help on the jobs front. According to the narrative of minimum wage advocates like EPI, that $5 billion in additional wages will get spent by low-skilled workers on goods and services, and with the power of a mythical multiplier that spending will ripple through the economy and magically stimulate the entire economy, create jobs, and bring about prosperity! Using Henry Hazlitts essay as a template (which is actually based on Bastiats original essay on the broken window fallacy from 1850), Ive written a new essay below to expose what might be called the blessings of the minimum wage fallacy on the eve of the 18 minimum wage increases schedule to take place next week. The local merchants who receive that $160 from Alexs additional spending now have additional income and profits every week, and they can spend some of that additional income and profits on goods and services. Neither can the 18 minimum wage hikes scheduled to take place on Monday have overall, positive net economic benefits next year. </p>

         <b>journalistsresource.org</b>
         <p>Under the $10.10 scenario, there would likely be a reduction of about 500,000 workers across the labor market, as businesses shed jobs, but about 16.5 million low-wage workers would see substantial gains in their earnings in an average week. Critics assert that the real effects of minimum-wage increases are negative: they hurt businesses, raise prices and ultimately are counterproductive for the working poor, as they can lead to unemployment. For a good sense of the partisan argument  and the statistics and studies that are often cited  see these position pieces from the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute and the left-leaning Center for American Progress. The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) illustrates this as follows:The BLS further notes that in 2015: Minimum wage workers tend to be young. Although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less. Among employed teenagers (ages 16 to 19) paid by the hour, about 11 percent earned the minimum wage or less, compared with about 2 percent of workers age 25 and older.  This relationship was significant across gender and income groups and largest among the highest percentiles of the BMI distribution. Real minimum wage decreases can explain 10 percent of the change in BMI since 1970. We conclude that the declining real minimum wage rates has contributed to the increasing rate of overweight and obesity in the United States. Studies to clarify the mechanism by which minimum wages may affect obesity might help determine appropriate policy responses. </p>

         <p>According to a poll taken earlier this year by the Pew Research Center, Americans are in favor of increasing the minimum wage from its current level by a wide margin (71% to 26%). The economics of low-wage jobs are complex, and resistance within Congress and the business community to raising the minimum wage is strong. Matthew Bidwell Yet in an era of growing income inequality and at a time when 6.6% of Americans  roughly 20.4 million people  are classified as being in deep poverty (a 4.5% increase since 2000), many view raising the minimum wage as a moral issue. The subsidy goes only to poor families, and it could be made more generous, he says.

         <p>Under the $10.10 scenario, there would likely be a reduction of about 500,000 workers across the labor market, as businesses shed jobs, but about 16.5 million low-wage workers would see substantial gains in their earnings in an average week. Critics assert that the real effects of minimum-wage increases are negative: they hurt businesses, raise prices and ultimately are counterproductive for the working poor, as they can lead to unemployment. For a good sense of the partisan argument  and the statistics and studies that are often cited  see these position pieces from the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute and the left-leaning Center for American Progress. The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) illustrates this as follows:The BLS further notes that in 2015: Minimum wage workers tend to be young. Although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less. Among employed teenagers (ages 16 to 19) paid by the hour, about 11 percent earned the minimum wage or less, compared with about 2 percent of workers age 25 and older.  This relationship was significant across gender and income groups and largest among the highest percentiles of the BMI distribution. Real minimum wage decreases can explain 10 percent of the change in BMI since 1970. We conclude that the declining real minimum wage rates has contributed to the increasing rate of overweight and obesity in the United States. Studies to clarify the mechanism by which minimum wages may affect obesity might help determine appropriate policy responses. </p>

         <p>Sabias own statistical research with economist Richard Burkhauser found no evidence that minimum wage increases were effective at reducing overall poverty rates or poverty rates among workers. A study by economists David Neumark and William Wascher found that while some poor workers who kept their jobs after minimum wage increases were lifted out of poverty, others lost their jobs and fell into poverty. The first reason is that minimum wages reduce the work available for low-skill workers:Many firms respond to minimum wage increases by substituting away from low-skilled labor and toward other inputs. Estimates of the employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage for low-skilled individuals generally range from -0.1 to as large as -0.3, suggesting that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces low-skilled employment by 1 to 3 percent. We find that only 13 percent of workers who would be affected live in poor households, while nearly two-thirds live in households with incomes over twice the poverty line, and over 40 percent live in households with incomes over three times the poverty line. </p>

         <p>According to a poll taken earlier this year by the Pew Research Center, Americans are in favor of increasing the minimum wage from its current level by a wide margin (71% to 26%). The economics of low-wage jobs are complex, and resistance within Congress and the business community to raising the minimum wage is strong. Matthew Bidwell Yet in an era of growing income inequality and at a time when 6.6% of Americans  roughly 20.4 million people  are classified as being in deep poverty (a 4.5% increase since 2000), many view raising the minimum wage as a moral issue. The subsidy goes only to poor families, and it could be made more generous, he says.

         <p>When labor unions and activists began calling for an increase in Americas minimum wage to $15 an hour, many thought it was a typical bargaining ploy, and that they would be pleased to receive much more modest increases. Many economists worry minimum wage increases tend to reduce employment, hurting young and less-educated workers the most. In a Congressional Budget Office report last year, policy analysts predicted that Obamas proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour would raise wages for 16 to 24 million people while eliminating about half a million jobs  a reasonable tradeoff worth embracing, in my view. We should also expand the Earned Income Tax Credits for childless adults, paid parental leave (funded by payroll taxes rather than mandates on employers), and education and training efforts for workers with low skills to better prepare them for good-paying jobs. We should work with employers to help them expand apprenticeships and other opportunities for workers to learn while they earn, and to generate better pathways from high school and community colleges into high-paying jobs. </p>

         <p>Many cities are also boosting low-income workers pay, among them Oakland, CA, which increased its minimum wage to $12.25 an hour, and Seattle, WA, which now requires large employers to pay at least $11.00 an hour. In addition to minimum wage workers who receive a direct increase, which portions of the workforce receive indirect raises from a minimum wage increase? Although the minimum wages enhances the bargaining power of many low-wage workers, an increased minimum wages effectiveness in doing so dissipates as it spreads across the wage spectrum, essentially disappearing for middle-class wage earners. Assessing the exact impact of raising the minimum wage on specific earners may require higher-quality hourly wage data on all workers than is currently available in standard household surveys in the United States. Using employer-reported data in the United Kingdom that may be more accurate than U. S. household survey data, Richard Dickens of the University of Sussex and Alan Manning and Tim Butcher of the UK Low Pay Commission find that although the minimum wage only affected the bottom 5 percent of the wage distribution, ripple effects extended to the 25th percentile. </p>

Here is the abstract:We review the burgeoning literature on the employment effects of minimum wages - in the United States and other countries - that was spurred by the new minimum wage research beginning in the early 1990s. If you accept as a fact that a minimum wage of $57.25 would reduce employment, and you accept as a fact that some workers are currently paid $7.25 per hour, then logic compels you to believe that a small increase in the minimum wage above $7.25 will have at least a small negative effect on employment. Will those advocating a higher minimum wage be willing meet face to face with disadvantaged members of society, who are willing and able to work, and explain why their employment needs to be sacrificed for higher wages for those who remain employed? </p>

         <p>Share On August 19, the Cato Institute released a study by me and Charles Hughes, The Work vs. Welfare Trade-Off, 2013: An Analysis of the Total Level of Welfare Benefits by State, showing that a family collecting welfare benefits from seven common programs  Temporary assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, Medicaid, WIC, public housing assistance, utilities assistance (LIHEAP) and free commodities  could receive more than what a minimum wage job would pay in 35 states. Attempts to simply mandate that businesses pay more, through increased minimum wages or living wage laws, as well as attempts to mandate employee benefits like health insurance (see Obamacare), primarily result in fewer jobs. The amount of compensation a worker receives is more or less a function of his or her productivity. More recently, Michael Hicks of Ball State University looked at the impact of the July 2008 minimum wage increase on unemployment rates in the United States and concluded that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage results in a roughly 0.19 percent increase in unemployment, meaning the loss of about 160,000 jobs. Greater prosperity eventually finds its way into higher wages for workers, including those at the bottom of the ladder. </p>

In 2015 real income of households at the 10th percentile of the income distribution grew 7.9%  the fastest growth since 1968. A new analysis by President Obamas Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that minimum wage increases implemented over the past three years by 18 states and the District of Columbia have also contributed to substantial increases in average wages for workers in low-wage jobs, helping to reverse a pattern of stagnant or falling real wages in the preceding years. Average wages and weekly earnings for those who work in the lowest paid jobs are at least 6.6% higher in these states than they would have been in the absence of these policy changes, based on a conservative counterfactual. The figure shows a slight downward trend prior to 2014 in the states that ultimately raised their minimum wages, while wages were growing, albeit at a slow pace, in the other group of states. </p>

In 2015 real income of households at the 10th percentile of the income distribution grew 7.9%  the fastest growth since 1968. A new analysis by President Obamas Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that minimum wage increases implemented over the past three years by 18 states and the District of Columbia have also contributed to substantial increases in average wages for workers in low-wage jobs, helping to reverse a pattern of stagnant or falling real wages in the preceding years. Average wages and weekly earnings for those who work in the lowest paid jobs are at least 6.6% higher in these states than they would have been in the absence of these policy changes, based on a conservative counterfactual. The figure shows a slight downward trend prior to 2014 in the states that ultimately raised their minimum wages, while wages were growing, albeit at a slow pace, in the other group of states. </p>

A study by economists David Neumark and William Wascher found that while some poor workers who kept their jobs after minimum wage increases were lifted out of poverty, others lost their jobs and fell into poverty. The first reason is that minimum wages reduce the work available for low-skill workers:Many firms respond to minimum wage increases by substituting away from low-skilled labor and toward other inputs. Estimates of the employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage for low-skilled individuals generally range from -0.1 to as large as -0.3, suggesting that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces low-skilled employment by 1 to 3 percent. We find that only 13 percent of workers who would be affected live in poor households, while nearly two-thirds live in households with incomes over twice the poverty line, and over 40 percent live in households with incomes over three times the poverty line. </p>

         <p>When labor unions and activists began calling for an increase in Americas minimum wage to $15 an hour, many thought it was a typical bargaining ploy, and that they would be pleased to receive much more modest increases. Many economists worry minimum wage increases tend to reduce employment, hurting young and less-educated workers the most. In a Congressional Budget Office report last year, policy analysts predicted that Obamas proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour would raise wages for 16 to 24 million people while eliminating about half a million jobs  a reasonable tradeoff worth embracing, in my view. We should also expand the Earned Income Tax Credits for childless adults, paid parental leave (funded by payroll taxes rather than mandates on employers), and education and training efforts for workers with low skills to better prepare them for good-paying jobs. We should work with employers to help them expand apprenticeships and other opportunities for workers to learn while they earn, and to generate better pathways from high school and community colleges into high-paying jobs. </p>

         <b>equitablegrowth.org</b>
         <p>Many cities are also boosting low-income workers pay, among them Oakland, CA, which increased its minimum wage to $12.25 an hour, and Seattle, WA, which now requires large employers to pay at least $11.00 an hour. In addition to minimum wage workers who receive a direct increase, which portions of the workforce receive indirect raises from a minimum wage increase? Although the minimum wages enhances the bargaining power of many low-wage workers, an increased minimum wages effectiveness in doing so dissipates as it spreads across the wage spectrum, essentially disappearing for middle-class wage earners. Assessing the exact impact of raising the minimum wage on specific earners may require higher-quality hourly wage data on all workers than is currently available in standard household surveys in the United States. Using employer-reported data in the United Kingdom that may be more accurate than U. S. household survey data, Richard Dickens of the University of Sussex and Alan Manning and Tim Butcher of the UK Low Pay Commission find that although the minimum wage only affected the bottom 5 percent of the wage distribution, ripple effects extended to the 25th percentile. </p>

         <p>As the worldwide economic slump drags on, the political drumbeat to either introduce minimum wage laws (read: Germany) or increase the minimums in countries where these laws exist  such as Indonesia  is becoming deafening. There are seven European Union (E.U.) countries in which no minimum wage is mandated (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, and Sweden). This point is even more pronounced when we look at rates of unemployment among the E. U.s youth  defined as those younger than 25 years of age (see the accompanying chart). Those data also show that the probability of an unemployed worker finding employment increases dramatically the closer an unemployed worker comes to the termination date for receipt of his unemployment benefits. In short, when the prospect of losing welfare benefits raises its head, unemployed workers magically tend to find work. </p>

The Economics The new letter claims that  the weight of evidence now show[s] that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers  . Here is the abstract:We review the burgeoning literature on the employment effects of minimum wages - in the United States and other countries - that was spurred by the new minimum wage research beginning in the early 1990s. If you accept as a fact that a minimum wage of $57.25 would reduce employment, and you accept as a fact that some workers are currently paid $7.25 per hour, then logic compels you to believe that a small increase in the minimum wage above $7.25 will have at least a small negative effect on employment. Will those advocating a higher minimum wage be willing meet face to face with disadvantaged members of society, who are willing and able to work, and explain why their employment needs to be sacrificed for higher wages for those who remain employed? </p>

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>Calls for minimum wage increasesat the federal, state, and local levelsare based on the premise that rises in the minimum wage will improve the economic well-being of low-paid workers. The argument that only a small share of workers is actually paid the minimum wage misses a key point: many of those who would be impacted by a raise in the minimum wage are actually low-wage workers making slightly above the minimum wage. Among those earning less than $10 an hour, only 12 percent were teenagers, as compared to 26 percent in 1979. Considering that near-minimum wage workers would also be affected, we find that an increase could raise the wages of up to 35 million workersthats 29.4 percent of the workforce. We also continue to explore the nations jobs gap, or the number of jobs needed to return to pre-recession employment levels. </p>

         <p>Share On August 19, the Cato Institute released a study by me and Charles Hughes, The Work vs. Welfare Trade-Off, 2013: An Analysis of the Total Level of Welfare Benefits by State, showing that a family collecting welfare benefits from seven common programs  Temporary assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, Medicaid, WIC, public housing assistance, utilities assistance (LIHEAP) and free commodities  could receive more than what a minimum wage job would pay in 35 states. Attempts to simply mandate that businesses pay more, through increased minimum wages or living wage laws, as well as attempts to mandate employee benefits like health insurance (see Obamacare), primarily result in fewer jobs. The amount of compensation a worker receives is more or less a function of his or her productivity. More recently, Michael Hicks of Ball State University looked at the impact of the July 2008 minimum wage increase on unemployment rates in the United States and concluded that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage results in a roughly 0.19 percent increase in unemployment, meaning the loss of about 160,000 jobs. Greater prosperity eventually finds its way into higher wages for workers, including those at the bottom of the ladder. </p>

         <p>According to a poll taken earlier this year by the Pew Research Center, Americans are in favor of increasing the minimum wage from its current level by a wide margin (71% to 26%). The economics of low-wage jobs are complex, and resistance within Congress and the business community to raising the minimum wage is strong. Matthew Bidwell Yet in an era of growing income inequality and at a time when 6.6% of Americans  roughly 20.4 million people  are classified as being in deep poverty (a 4.5% increase since 2000), many view raising the minimum wage as a moral issue. The subsidy goes only to poor families, and it could be made more generous, he says. Job training programs targeted at low-skilled workers represent another important part of the solution, according to Mike Grandinetti, a professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Hult International Business School. </p>

         <p>President Obama has made raising the minimum wage a centerpiece of his campaign against "income inequality." In his most recent State of the Union Address, he called for raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour over the next 3 years. Numerous governors are also pushing to increase their state minimum as well. No doubt such proposals are politically popular. On the other hand it would almost certainly reduce employment opportunities, especially for those low skilled, entry level workers for whom a job represents the first rungs on the ladder of opportunity. </p>

         <p>He notes that the loss in cash and noncash transfers and tax credits among those who would benefit the most from minimum wage increases is likely to dampen some of the benefits, especially among those around the poverty line, yet the resulting public savings could be ploughed back into further shoring up the safety netin turn further increasing the complementarity between minimum wages and income support for raising the incomes of families at the bottom of the income ladder. He notes that typically, eligibility for supplemental nutrition assistance, for example, requires income to be less than 130 percent of the federal poverty threshold, which for this population binds just under the 15th percentile. On average, those in the bottom quartile of the income distribution can expect an approximately $525 increase in annual income from the minimum-wage policy; the gains are largest around the 15th percentile. Between 1979 and 2012, the declining minimum wage was responsible for 48 percent of the increase in female wage inequality between the bottom and middle of the wage distribution. Figure 4 Zipperer and his co-authors show that this map divides states into two groups: states with high average minimum wages and states with low average minimum wages during the 19792014 period. Congress should also take care to make sure that other benefits for low-wage workers provide a full package for low-wage workers and their families, as families will also need help with access to affordable and quality health care, childcare, and housing, even at a higher minimum wage. </p>

This relationship was significant across gender and income groups and largest among the highest percentiles of the BMI distribution. Real minimum wage decreases can explain 10 percent of the change in BMI since 1970. We conclude that the declining real minimum wage rates has contributed to the increasing rate of overweight and obesity in the United States. Studies to clarify the mechanism by which minimum wages may affect obesity might help determine appropriate policy responses. </p>

He notes that typically, eligibility for supplemental nutrition assistance, for example, requires income to be less than 130 percent of the federal poverty threshold, which for this population binds just under the 15th percentile. On average, those in the bottom quartile of the income distribution can expect an approximately $525 increase in annual income from the minimum-wage policy; the gains are largest around the 15th percentile. Between 1979 and 2012, the declining minimum wage was responsible for 48 percent of the increase in female wage inequality between the bottom and middle of the wage distribution. Figure 4 Zipperer and his co-authors show that this map divides states into two groups: states with high average minimum wages and states with low average minimum wages during the 19792014 period. Congress should also take care to make sure that other benefits for low-wage workers provide a full package for low-wage workers and their families, as families will also need help with access to affordable and quality health care, childcare, and housing, even at a higher minimum wage. </p>

         <p>This column examines the impact of the more recent state increases on wages, weekly earnings, and employment among workers in the low-wage leisure and hospitality Industry. In 2015 real income of households at the 10th percentile of the income distribution grew 7.9%  the fastest growth since 1968. A new analysis by President Obamas Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that minimum wage increases implemented over the past three years by 18 states and the District of Columbia have also contributed to substantial increases in average wages for workers in low-wage jobs, helping to reverse a pattern of stagnant or falling real wages in the preceding years. Average wages and weekly earnings for those who work in the lowest paid jobs are at least 6.6% higher in these states than they would have been in the absence of these policy changes, based on a conservative counterfactual. The figure shows a slight downward trend prior to 2014 in the states that ultimately raised their minimum wages, while wages were growing, albeit at a slow pace, in the other group of states. </p>

         <p>Sabias own statistical research with economist Richard Burkhauser found no evidence that minimum wage increases were effective at reducing overall poverty rates or poverty rates among workers. A study by economists David Neumark and William Wascher found that while some poor workers who kept their jobs after minimum wage increases were lifted out of poverty, others lost their jobs and fell into poverty. The first reason is that minimum wages reduce the work available for low-skill workers:Many firms respond to minimum wage increases by substituting away from low-skilled labor and toward other inputs. Estimates of the employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage for low-skilled individuals generally range from -0.1 to as large as -0.3, suggesting that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces low-skilled employment by 1 to 3 percent. We find that only 13 percent of workers who would be affected live in poor households, while nearly two-thirds live in households with incomes over twice the poverty line, and over 40 percent live in households with incomes over three times the poverty line. </p>

         <p>As the worldwide economic slump drags on, the political drumbeat to either introduce minimum wage laws (read: Germany) or increase the minimums in countries where these laws exist  such as Indonesia  is becoming deafening. There are seven European Union (E.U.) countries in which no minimum wage is mandated (Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, and Sweden). This point is even more pronounced when we look at rates of unemployment among the E. U.s youth  defined as those younger than 25 years of age (see the accompanying chart). Those data also show that the probability of an unemployed worker finding employment increases dramatically the closer an unemployed worker comes to the termination date for receipt of his unemployment benefits. In short, when the prospect of losing welfare benefits raises its head, unemployed workers magically tend to find work. </p>

The Economics The new letter claims that  the weight of evidence now show[s] that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers  . Here is the abstract:We review the burgeoning literature on the employment effects of minimum wages - in the United States and other countries - that was spurred by the new minimum wage research beginning in the early 1990s. If you accept as a fact that a minimum wage of $57.25 would reduce employment, and you accept as a fact that some workers are currently paid $7.25 per hour, then logic compels you to believe that a small increase in the minimum wage above $7.25 will have at least a small negative effect on employment. Will those advocating a higher minimum wage be willing meet face to face with disadvantaged members of society, who are willing and able to work, and explain why their employment needs to be sacrificed for higher wages for those who remain employed? </p>

         <p>Share On August 19, the Cato Institute released a study by me and Charles Hughes, The Work vs. Welfare Trade-Off, 2013: An Analysis of the Total Level of Welfare Benefits by State, showing that a family collecting welfare benefits from seven common programs  Temporary assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, Medicaid, WIC, public housing assistance, utilities assistance (LIHEAP) and free commodities  could receive more than what a minimum wage job would pay in 35 states. Attempts to simply mandate that businesses pay more, through increased minimum wages or living wage laws, as well as attempts to mandate employee benefits like health insurance (see Obamacare), primarily result in fewer jobs. The amount of compensation a worker receives is more or less a function of his or her productivity. More recently, Michael Hicks of Ball State University looked at the impact of the July 2008 minimum wage increase on unemployment rates in the United States and concluded that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage results in a roughly 0.19 percent increase in unemployment, meaning the loss of about 160,000 jobs. Greater prosperity eventually finds its way into higher wages for workers, including those at the bottom of the ladder. </p>

In his most recent State of the Union Address, he called for raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour over the next 3 years. Numerous governors are also pushing to increase their state minimum as well. No doubt such proposals are politically popular.

         <b>voxeu.org</b>
         <p>This column examines the impact of the more recent state increases on wages, weekly earnings, and employment among workers in the low-wage leisure and hospitality Industry. In 2015 real income of households at the 10th percentile of the income distribution grew 7.9%  the fastest growth since 1968. A new analysis by President Obamas Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that minimum wage increases implemented over the past three years by 18 states and the District of Columbia have also contributed to substantial increases in average wages for workers in low-wage jobs, helping to reverse a pattern of stagnant or falling real wages in the preceding years. Average wages and weekly earnings for those who work in the lowest paid jobs are at least 6.6% higher in these states than they would have been in the absence of these policy changes, based on a conservative counterfactual. The figure shows a slight downward trend prior to 2014 in the states that ultimately raised their minimum wages, while wages were growing, albeit at a slow pace, in the other group of states. </p>

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>When labor unions and activists began calling for an increase in Americas minimum wage to $15 an hour, many thought it was a typical bargaining ploy, and that they would be pleased to receive much more modest increases. Many economists worry minimum wage increases tend to reduce employment, hurting young and less-educated workers the most. In a Congressional Budget Office report last year, policy analysts predicted that Obamas proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour would raise wages for 16 to 24 million people while eliminating about half a million jobs  a reasonable tradeoff worth embracing, in my view. We should also expand the Earned Income Tax Credits for childless adults, paid parental leave (funded by payroll taxes rather than mandates on employers), and education and training efforts for workers with low skills to better prepare them for good-paying jobs. We should work with employers to help them expand apprenticeships and other opportunities for workers to learn while they earn, and to generate better pathways from high school and community colleges into high-paying jobs. </p>

         <b>www.brookings.edu</b>
         <p>Calls for minimum wage increasesat the federal, state, and local levelsare based on the premise that rises in the minimum wage will improve the economic well-being of low-paid workers. The argument that only a small share of workers is actually paid the minimum wage misses a key point: many of those who would be impacted by a raise in the minimum wage are actually low-wage workers making slightly above the minimum wage. Among those earning less than $10 an hour, only 12 percent were teenagers, as compared to 26 percent in 1979. Considering that near-minimum wage workers would also be affected, we find that an increase could raise the wages of up to 35 million workersthats 29.4 percent of the workforce. We also continue to explore the nations jobs gap, or the number of jobs needed to return to pre-recession employment levels. </p>

         <b>journalistsresource.org</b>
         <p>Under the $10.10 scenario, there would likely be a reduction of about 500,000 workers across the labor market, as businesses shed jobs, but about 16.5 million low-wage workers would see substantial gains in their earnings in an average week. Critics assert that the real effects of minimum-wage increases are negative: they hurt businesses, raise prices and ultimately are counterproductive for the working poor, as they can lead to unemployment. For a good sense of the partisan argument  and the statistics and studies that are often cited  see these position pieces from the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute and the left-leaning Center for American Progress. The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) illustrates this as follows:The BLS further notes that in 2015: Minimum wage workers tend to be young. Although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less. Among employed teenagers (ages 16 to 19) paid by the hour, about 11 percent earned the minimum wage or less, compared with about 2 percent of workers age 25 and older.  This relationship was significant across gender and income groups and largest among the highest percentiles of the BMI distribution. Real minimum wage decreases can explain 10 percent of the change in BMI since 1970. We conclude that the declining real minimum wage rates has contributed to the increasing rate of overweight and obesity in the United States. Studies to clarify the mechanism by which minimum wages may affect obesity might help determine appropriate policy responses. </p>

         <b>journalistsresource.org</b>
         <p>Raising the minimum wage results in lower teen birth rates, especially among white and Hispanic adolescents, a new study suggests. Much of the newest research focuses on how it may influence peoples health. A 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, for example, indicates that raising the minimum wage to $15 in New York City would have prevented as many as 5,500 premature deaths between 2008 and 2012. A 2016 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests a higher minimum wage is associated with higher infant birth weights and a decline in smoking during pregnancy. A $1 increase yields about 0.49 fewer births per 1,000 Hispanic teen girls, compared to 0.11 fewer births per 1,000 white, non-Hispanic teen girls. </p>
